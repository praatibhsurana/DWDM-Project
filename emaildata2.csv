"" the government , way back in 1995 , has  modified the sales tax rate to 4 per cent to discourage the import of naphtha  from gujarat by electrical companies operating in maharashtra . the decision  was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphtha  at reduced rates within the state , "" government sources added . sources said  that these companies had to pay nearly 15 . 3 per cent sales tax on naphtha  that was procured from gujarat . however , following their representation , the  government slashed the sales tax rate to 4 per cent .  the state finance department ' s opinion , which would be presented before the  state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision , deserves special  significance especially when the state energy department and the loss - making  maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) have wholeheartedly supported the  dpc ' s cause and recommended the sales tax waiver . dpc , which was asked by the  union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country in  view of excess availability , in its presentation to the state government and  to mseb , had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to  pass on the additional burden on the mseb which would be ultimately passed on  to its consumers . dpc had also told the state government that it had not paid  sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from glencore in the calender year  2000 .  sources from the state energy department and mseb have stressed on the need  for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burden .  they have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales tax  exemption to dpc because the ioc , at the behest of the centre , has tried to  match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed  memorandum of agreement with dpc . "" if the state finance department sticks to  its views , it may hurt the state as a whole , "" sources from the state energy  department and mseb said . dpc will procure naphtha at rs 11 , 050 per ton from  ioc during the calender year 2001 as compared to the rs 10 , 050 per tonne  price quoted by glencore . the naphtha price comprises $ 175 per tonne free on  board ( fob ) , 21 . 8 per cent of customs duty , 5 . 4 per cent of sales tax and  $ 18 . 87 of premium .  dpc senior vice president mukesh tyagi reiterated that the company has  already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on  naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers . "" sales tax is a pass through  and mseb , which will have to bear the additional burden , will pass it on the  consumers , "" he added .  - - - - - - -  centre yet to receive proposal on enron  thursday jan 18 2001  centre on wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from  maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with the enron  promoted dhabol power project relating to cost and surplus power . asked about  the reports that maharashtra government was sending a proposal that centre  buy surplus power from dhabol power company through power trading  corporation , power minister suresh prabhu said "" we have not received any  proposal . "" "" we are carefully watching the situation and will await a concrete  proposal before intervening in this matter , "" parbhu said on the sidelines of  greentech environment excellence awards ceremony , here . asked whether there  was any possibility of the government asking the power trading corporation to  buy power from the dhabol power corporation , prabhu replied "" what will the  ptc do with the power ? ""  prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before  approaching the centre for payment of dues . mseb had earlier declined to pick  up its 15 per cent stake in phase ii of the 1444 mw project . the enron issue  has been hanging fire with the maharashtra state electricity board unable to  clear the dues of dpc as a result of the skyrocketing prices of naphtha  infact mseb has asked dpc to backdown completely leading to a situation where  dpc has stopped production at the facility from the begining of the  month . state government has stepped in with support to the tune of rs 114  crore to enable mseb to clear the dues for october . mseb dues to dpc for  november and december amount to over rs 300 crores .",0

( f - pcr ) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines .  to date , genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease , a disease affecting elk and deer in north america . diagnostic assays for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease are in the final stages of development . vaccines for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease , both of which are diseases affecting cattle , are in advanced stages of development . in the future , the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases / animals , the immediate targets being mad cow , hoof mouth , west nile and newcastle .  genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e . d . r . f . gene sequence . the e . d . r . f . gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human . the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow ( bse ) in cattle , cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans  the company ' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost . the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr , dna analyzing robotics equipment . genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician . the project will prove highly profitable at approx $ 4 . 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way .  a multi - billion dollar , international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe .  japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone . they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad ' s rapid test . costs are between $ 20 and $ 40 dollars per test . most importantly , other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed . testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly .  japan spent between $ 60 million - $ 120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004 .  genethera ' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system . the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing . the company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test .  management :  dr . tony milici -

"" i would disagree . i think that its quite intuitive  that this model should get closer to the black - scholes price as what is  defined as the "" jump "" component becomes just part of the main price  distribution , which happens if we define a jump to be only a 1 - sigma  event . the table does show , however , that the results of using this model  are very sensitive to exactly how you choose to define a "" jump "" ( i . e . 2 - sigma  or 3 - sigma . . . events ) , and this is one difficulty in using the model in  practice .  3 . in the paragraph after the table , i don ' t understand the argument about  hedging the option . especially about buying a swap which would pay on the  difference between the strike and fs . this seems non - sensical .  4 . i could not follow the logic of the last two sentences of the article , so  this point should probably be explained more clearly .  - - stinson  vince j kaminski  08 / 18 / 2000 08 : 15 am  to : grant masson / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , alex  huang / corp / enron @ enron  cc :  subject : alex ' s paper  minor changes i made to alex ' s paper .  vince",0

203,"Subject: re : progress  steve ,  thanks a lot . i think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards  understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no  bugs in translation of a business problem ( for example , complicated  credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality ) into the  code .  regarding tanya ' s attitude . just a few points .  1 . i don ' t think she has the skills to do the system administrator ' s work  and she does not have the  necessary privileges . this explains why she keeps asking winston for help .  it ' s  not that the work is beneath her .  2 . some members of tanya ' s team came to me complaining about winston .  he effectively told them to go away and work on the "" research projects ""  and that he would take care of the it issues . i don ' t think that it ' s just  tanya ' s issue ,  though i agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful .  3 . the reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat on  tanya and  me whenever there is any performance problems and / or they intuitively  disagree with the results of a run . they could not care less about the  demarcation line between it and research . they also want tanya  to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code .  the bottom line is that we are in full agreement : tanya and  winston have to work as a team and i shall work on my end to make sure that  it happens .  credit is emerging as a critical issue for enron for the next few weeks and  the system cannot fail .  vince  from : stephen stock / enron @ enronxgate on 01 / 11 / 2001 08 : 23 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : progress  vince ,  i got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking  about some specific solutions to performance of it systems . . . in particular  distributed processing . also i heard that you had concerns about the use of  multiple languages etc . . . .  both of these sound like what i was discussing with you on previous  occasions . . . do you feel the need to discuss these further ?  the multi - language issue isn ' t really that much of an issue , as the current  system is 98 % java right now . although i am a big fan of c / c + + ( it is my main  development skill ) , i am also very aware that java is a much more evolved  and robust language . i had serious doubts about the performance , but i ' ve had  a review conducted , and the results are showing the sun unix implementation  to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than c / c + + because of something  they call hot - spot technology . ( its an instruction caching technique , i  believe ) . the concerns i expressed to you , were really about how technical  people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively  meaningless metric like portability .  on the issue of distributed processing . . . the original review i had conducted  by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution , and as zhiyong wei  is already working on global valuation project , winston is actively working  with zhiyong to see if he can model the var architecture on that , and also to  find a common valuation piece between the systems .  i ' d like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some  time over the next few days ?  also , i sat in on the tanya / winston meeting yesterday and as per our  discussion at the elevator , i attempted to help her argument by suggesting to  all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code . . . i . e .  seperating research domain problems from it problems .  she said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could  get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were . i asked her how she would  measure that , and she said she would instrument the code manually by  inserting timing elements at strategic points . i mentioned that a profiling  tool could probably do this job for her . tanya again said that stepping  through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code , and that  studying documentation wasn ' t enough .  about 6 weeks ago , i commissioned a team to document the system down to  psuedo - code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon .  ( in fact i ' ve asked for a draft copy to be given to tanya right now ) , and  winston is also working on a draft research / it "" working together "" document ,  which will identify how the exchange of information takes place .  tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated it developer to do  all the environment setup for her , because she doesn ' t really want to have to  do that . i think that this is probably the root cause of the issue . the it  guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good , as  it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her . she is  claiming that they are un - cooperative . . . . they are claiming that she  continually asks the same questions about set - up over and over again , and  doesn ' t seem to want to learn how to do it . winston on the other hand , could  be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and  an it issue and ask for help from research .  i think you debbie and i need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely .  i have asked tanya and winston to go ahead and work very closely together  over the next few days . . . . and debbie brackett and i will review their  progress on friday .  in the meantime l ' ll be looking at setting up a working test environment that  doesn ' t involve my main quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer  term solution .  regards  steve",0

"" breakthrough "" products in the vspc pipeline  vpsc products in the process of commercialization are expected to enable up to 10 hours of laptop computer usage , and three weeks of cell phone operation using fuel cells , gps - free navigation , especially for places where gps doesn ' t work ( a top dod priority ) , automated analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray imaging ( homeland security ) , identification of narcotics , chemicals , and biological weapons .  another total breakthrough , with a nanotechnology based mass spectrometer is a portable , carry - on suitcase size device that processes identifies one molecule at a time : further miniaturization is expected to shoebox size , compared with stationary desk size provided by today ' s competitors .  significant recurring income from fuel cell batteries  in five years , annual revenue from disposable fuel cartridges for fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices is expected to range between $ 7 billion on the low side to $ 45 billion on the high side . that market does not exist today .  vspc ' s fuel cell cartridge business model is similar to the well - known razor / razor blade model , which is to sell the razor and then make much more money on the recurring blade business . the fuel cell is a razor , and the disposable fuel cartridge is the razor blade .  another analogy is the  flashlight / battery model . imagine if a company had the primary intellectual property involved in manufacturing flashlights . it would probably license that technology to major flashlight manufacturers , in return for help in dominating the recurring flashlight battery business .  in this case vspc has the proprietary rights to the ' flashlight ' - - the fuel cell - - and intends to sell the "" flashlight battery "" - - specifically , disposable fuel cartridges , for an end - user price of $ 2 - $ 3 each .  vspc is currently negotiating to provide its patented fuel cell technology to major computer manufacturers , in return for their agreement to use disposable fuel cartridges developed by vspc , the manufacturing of which will be outsourced to well - known , major plants in the far east .  intellectual property protected with patents  vspc ' s fuel cell technology , for example , is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents .  strategic partners lend credibility  to create a cost - effective worldwide footprint , emerging companies must partner with branded , global companies who have strong management teams and significant resources .  vspc is partnering with major , well - known market leaders who have management , resources and global branding . partners are attracted to vspc ' s technology , and expect to gain competitive advantage by integrating patented , proprietary technology obtained from vspc .  for example , in the fuel cell business , toshiba , nec , sanyo , hitachi and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . these companies are potential strategic partners for vspc . to better work with japanese manufacturers , vspc has opened a tokyo office .

"" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""  at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",0

302,"Subject: industry giants can ' t match this opportunity  another ground breaking news alert from rlyc .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come .  although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year .  an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry  in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments .  the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally .  just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company .  below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years .  rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force !  rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards .  but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc  for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem .  rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms .  rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards  earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations .  the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers .  this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues .  $ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries  mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico  with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances .  the problems with traditional money transfer methods  with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use .  with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets .  what is the best way to send remittances ?  by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country .  the process is extremely easy and cost - effective . funds can be added to the card ' s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations . the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms . it could not be any simpler .  rlyc has already begun filling orders  in june of this year , rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2 , 000 pin - based stored value cards . the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2 , 000 new stored - value cards being put into circulation each month . this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services . moreover , though other programs it is working on , it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months .  rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one - stop financial centers  rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage , monthly fees , as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning . loading centers are retail locations , such as convenience stores , check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer . rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors , vendors and distributors , and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100 , 000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition .  rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings  some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial , auto and sba loans , mortgages , all types of affinity group ( loyalty / rewards ) cards , pharmacy discount cards , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health savings accounts and health and life insurance . rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace , should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f - a - s - t ! ! !  rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions  through a well - planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies , rlyc plans to fuel its growth . it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures , acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry .  rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions . with corporate network ' s assistance , it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty .  rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account ( hsa ) market  rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp . , an employee benefit and financial services company , to provide health saving account ( hsa ) stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre - tax dollars .  health savings accounts ( hsa ) are tax - sheltered savings accounts similar to an ira , but earmarked for medical expenses and are part of a high deductible insurance plan . deposits are 100 % tax - deductible for the self - employed and for employees of companies that offer an hsa .  this could be an enormous new market for rlyc  it is estimated that all millions of non - elderly americans will soon have access to a health savings account , creating a market of unprecedented potential . in fact , due to the rising costs of employer - sponsored health plans , it is also estimated that one in every two major employers in the united states is considering consumer directed health plans and hsa for their employees .  experienced stored value card and financial services industry executive named ceo of relay capital corp .  e . reese bogle iii , experienced financial services and stored value card industry executive , has been named relay ' s . most recently he was one of the founders , and served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of interstate net bank ( www . isnbank . com ) , establishing it as a visa principal member .  prior to this , mr . bogle , was vp of e * trade bank ' s corporate development and strategic alliances group and president of telebanc insurance services , inc . he also served as vp and marketing director of premium bank , and held a variety of managerial and marketing positions at leading financial services companies .  relay will be adding real depth experience to its management team  the next step is to bring a well qualified management team to relay capital said mr . bogle . once the team is onboard , we intend to build relay capital into a diversified financial services provider that , in addition to looking for exponential growth of recurring revenue generated from individual stored card usage , as well as other financial service activities occurring at our card loading centers or its virtual financial centers , we potentially plan to provide : commercial loans , auto loans , sba loans , mortgages , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health benefits ( dental , vision ) , life insurance benefits , pharmacy drug discounts , loyalty and reward programs , and shopping discount programs .  with innovative products and services targeted to trillion dollar market ; a host of powerful partners ; key acquisitions in the works ; orders already coming in ; and a top -

387,"Subject: california update 3 / 15 / 01  executive summary  ? davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for  past utility debt  ? davis and pg & e negotiations at a standstill , sticking point is net short  for pg & e this summer  ? as the days go on with no word of a secured deal , involuntary bankruptcy  chances increase significantly among small generators and qfs  ? ferc would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions  for california  california public utility commission rate increases  today may be the turning point as the ca puc reviews the size of the  department of water resources ( dwr ) rate increase to be passed along to  consumers on their electricity bills . until now , davis has considered rate  hikes to be political suicide , but there may be some relief for him from  consumer groups . sources indicate that one of california ' s main consumer  advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption ,  but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt . dwr ,  which is currently buying power on behalf of the state , needs more income to  securitize the planned $ 10 b bond issue that is key part of davis ' plan to  sign long term power contracts . as dwr continues to spend $ 40 to $ 60 m every  day on power purchases , a well placed source informed us the dwr is  essentially bankrupt . it currently has no money for normal activities such  as ordering supplies , purchasing new equipment , etc . the department of  finance is forwarding dwr money from where ever it can ( parks , other  programs ) to purchase power , but dwr ' s hands are tied until revenue bonds are  issued . the california state treasurer phil angelides will be submitting a  recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $ 10  billion worth of state bonds .  davis & pg & e at odds  sources report that davis and pg & e negotiations are facing two difficult  challenges : 1 ) pg & e wants 2 . 9 times book , which is far more than consumer  groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines ( sce accepted 2 . 3 ) ,  and 2 ) pg & e needs relief from davis for pg & es legal responsibility to be the  ultimate power purchaser for the state , and at this point davis wants to  limit further state energy power purchases ( especially for summer ) . the  utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars  further in the red ( $ 3 to $ 4 b ) and pg a measure that if accomplished would  provide davis with even less negotiating power .  with all this activity , davis is starting to lose support in the state  legislature . sources report increasing tension between the governor and  state senate president pro - tem john burton . burton has just announced a  special senate committee will investigate the generators for evidence of  price manipulation , and the state auditor is also planning an investigation .  davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being  picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later .  qf ' s most likely source of involuntary bankruptcy  sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience  and force bankruptcy on the utilities . sb 47 x may have been california ' s  qualified facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing  against pg & e , socal ed , and sdg & e . the bill designed to cut the qf ' s costs  and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the state ' s  senate . sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further  investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates .  out with hebert , in with wood  the bush administration favors replacing hebert , jr . with texas puc head pat  wood . there is an intense battle behind the scenes between senate republican  leader trent lott , who favors hebert , and president bush , who wants wood .  the administration would prefer wood because they do not want ferc to pick a  fight with davis which means bush might ultimately lose some western states  in 2004 . in effort to tone down the recent press reports , hebert has made  several token concessions to california , including $ 69 million worth of power  refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and  power plant installation .  it ' s is expected that ferc would most likely approve any transmission deal  that davis could complete but with a list of conditions . some conditions  might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well  as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic administrative actions in  the west next year . the bush administration is opposed to price caps and  believes in free market solutions . the administration is also considering  whether it might be a good idea to privatize federally - owned assets such as  bpa .",0

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ?  recently ,  we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and  how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the  next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could  have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all  over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became  obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to  bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics .  merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the  potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another  source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this  business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the  single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online  gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be  an ideal time to is time to invest .  we decided to  find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with  a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging ,  publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a  close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months .  although  ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at  the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old .  the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno .  and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the  keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it  gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream  gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online  gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers  these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the  company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in  the investment community and driving up its stock price .  after a successful north american launch ,  gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese  and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business  decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest  source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach .  what  does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game ,  one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced  management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . .  to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more .  first source data inc .  4535 west sahara ave # 217  las vegas nevada 89102  disclosure and disclaimer  investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first  source data , inc .

427,"Subject: corrected : new update on ppi model for inflation book  dear all ,  i followed up on the suggestions at the conference call as follows : -  1 ) use less data  unfortunately , kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less  robust , in fact dramatically so , and so eliminates the possibility of using  less data . the model tested was the rpi ( month + 15 ) ppi pre - empts the moves in rpi by about 8 months . the  magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced . this shows that if we had  more detail in our rpi forward curve , then the ppi model would reflect those  peaks and humps adequately .  conclusion  i therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates rpi , rpi [ t + 15 ]  and deviations of brent crude from long - term average . the new model is  plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is  depicted in blue .  the new model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve : it is  significantly more robust and stable than the existing one , and it is  considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients , which results in us  having more confidence in our monthly p it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the  long - term average of $ 18 . 80 was the best form of the variable to use ( for  predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is  used ) . the three new equations developed were : -  pllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + c . ( datedbrentcrude - 18 . 8 ) + constant ,  where n is 14 , 15 or 16  [ reddish curves ]  r - squared approx 0 . 49  f - stat approx 32  the chart below shows what our projected pllu curve would be given this  equation , and also the three best relations from before which were based upon  current and future rpi :  pllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + constant , where n is 14 , 15 or 16  [ greenish curves ]  r - squared approx 0 . 47  f - stat approx 45  comparison of models  as you can see , the two equations differ in the very short - term and very  long - term ; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short - term  predictions of 3 . 0 % to 3 . 2 % over the next six months . the greenish curves  predict pllu in the range of 2 . 5 % to 2 . 8 % over the next six months .  the curves are then very similar until 2009 , when the models including crude  break - away to the upside , relative to the falling rpi curve . the model based  purely on rpi hugs the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term . this  is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009  ( which we don ' t ) .  suggestion  what could be useful now is a differently - specified model designed to  forecast only the next 3 months , using auto - regressive or auto - regressive  error terms . this model would be far more accurate in the near - term , and we  could include this information onto the front of this long - term model . this  may be useful , despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time  buckets .  back - testing  all the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data  sample used ( based mainly on 1990 s "" new paradigm "" economy ) .  hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele - conference ;  your ideas on this would be appreciated .  regards ,  anjam  x 35383",0

"" vincejkaminski ""  cc :  subject : ? preface for book  vince ,  hope you are well .  we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and ?  you  kindly offered that you would provide this . is this still ? possible ? we  realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ? ahead and wrote  something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or ? re - write the  preface , that would be very appreciated . let me know ? what your thoughts  are .  thanks ,  julie  ( we ' re getting close )  preface  one of our main objectives in ? writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk  management has been to bring ? together as many of the various approaches  for the  pricing and risk management ? energy derivatives as possible , to discuss  in - depth  the models , and to show how ? they relate to each other . in this ? way we hope  to  help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide ? range of  energy  derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses a ? consistent  modelling framework . we ? believe that for practitioners this last point is  very  important and we continue ? to stress in our articles and presentations the  dangers of having flawed risk ? management and giving arbitrage opportunities  to  your competitors by using ? ad - hoc and inconsistent models for different  instruments and markets ( see also others who propose consistent ? models ? ) .  however , it is not ? our wish to concentrate on one particular model or  models ,  at the exclusion of ? the others because we believe that the choice should  rest  with the user ? ( although it will probably be clear from our discussions the  model ( s ) we ? prefer ) . we therefore try and give ? as clear account as possible  of the advantage and disadvantages of all the ? models so that the reader can  make an informed choice as to the models which ? best suit their needs .  in order to meet our objectives the ? book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to ?  model and  price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the ? book . in  addition to introducing ? the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline ? the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and  monte carlo simulation for ? derivative pricing , which are used throughout the  book .  in chapter 2 we discuss the ? analysis of spot energy prices . as ? well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes ? that  can  be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of geometric  brownian motion as well as ? mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump  processes , discussing each and ? showing how they can be simulated and their  parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince ? kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron  corp . , discusses volatility ? estimation in energy commodity markets . ? this  chapter builds on the previous one . it examines in detail the methods , ?  merits  and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different ? pricing  models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and electricity  markets are used to illustrate ? the technical and interpretative aspects of  calculating volatility .  chapter 4 examines forward curves ? in the energy markets . although ? such  curves  are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial ? markets , the  difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well ? defined  curves .  in this chapter we ? describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the  building of forward ? curves from market instruments . we ? outline the three  main  approaches which have been applied to building forward ? curves in energy  markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric approach , and ? deriving  analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors .  chapter 5 presents an overview of ? structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy  swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options ,  and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and ? multi - factor models of the energy spot  price  and the pricing of some standard ? energy derivatives . closed form ? solutions  for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices ? both on  the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in ? this  chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience yield and interest  rate model .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of ? path dependent and american style options  can  be evaluated for the models in ? chapter 6 . simulation schemes are ? developed  for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety ? of  path  dependent options . in order ? to price options which incorporate early  exercise  opportunities , a trinomial ? tree scheme is developed . this tree ? is built to  be  consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to ? price exotic  as  well as standard european and american style options .  chapter 8 describes a methodology ? for valuing energy options based on  modelling  the whole of the market observed ? forward curve . the approach results ? in a  multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined volatility structures  can be of an extremely general ? form . closed - form solutions are ? developed  for  pricing standard european options , and efficient monte carlo ? schemes are  presented for pricing exotic options . the chapter closes with a discussion of  the valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk ? management of energy derivative positions . ?  in  this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions ? that  trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem ?  of  managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a portfolio  containing derivatives and look ? at extensions to gamma hedging ?  illustrating  the techniques using both spot and ? forward curve models . the general ? model  presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor hedging of a ?  portfolio  of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  chapter 10 examines the key risk ? management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing ? energy derivative products . after ?  discussing  the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ? ( volatilities ,  covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then compare the fours  major ? methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical  simulation and ? monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same portfolio  of  energy ? options . in this chapter we also ? look at testing the var estimates  for  various underlying energy market ? variables .  finally , in chapter 11 we review ? modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look  in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) )  and ? creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial ? products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed  information is publicly available . together these provide an extensive set ?  of  tools with which to measure credit risk . we present numerical examples of  applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  before ? we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book  are tools ? which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how  both  the ? tool ? ? and the market works . the ? techniques we describe are certainly  not  ? magic wands ? which can be waved at ? data and risk management problems to  provide instant and perfect solutions . to quote from the riskmetrics  technical  document ? ? no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and  professional judgement in managing risk . ? . ? however , the right tools ,  correctly  used make the job a lot ? easier !",0

placed sources in the government , the company has informed the  madhav godbole panel that it would be meeting on may 11 . earlier reports had  indicated that the discussions with the panel would take place on may 5 .  according to sources , enron would be meeting the panel with representatives  of its lenders and shareholders . the godbole committee , that studied the  current power purchase agreement , has called for cancellation of the present  tariff structure , renegotiation of the lng and shipping contract , removal of  dollar denomination as far as fixed charges of the tariff is concerned , debt  restructuring and the formation of a committee to renegotiate the power  purchase agreement . these suggestions , it seems , may not be acceptable to  enron . the maharashtra government accepted the report and asked the godbole  committee to renegotiate . the committee has been given a month  , s time to  renegotiate on behalf of the state government with dpc for a new ppa .  the committee has opined that since the lng facility of 5 mmpta is far in  excess of what is required by the plant ( only 2 . 1 mmpta of which 1 . 8 mmpta is  on take or pay ) , it should be separated into a distinct facility whose  capital costs should not be reflected in the fuel charge , not as take or pay .  it should instead be only in proportion to the fuel regassified for the power  generation . using the entire allocated gas requires an unusually high plf .  instead , the surplus gas can be sold to other players like petronet or enron  ,  s own metgas .  & it is important to distribute the cost over the entire  capacity and not just the amount sold to the power plant ,  8 says the  committee . similarly , it has been suggested that enron could lease out the  harbour facilities as a common facility to other lng importers . on the lng  contract negotiated by enron for long - term supplies , it has said that since  the lng market has witnessed great changes , particularly as far as prices are  concerned , the power company should take advantage of spot buys and  renegotiate the contract accordingly .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  the times of india , friday , may 04 , 2001  enron ready to take part in ppa talk , nitin yeshwantrao  the enron management has finally agreed to participate in a ' discussion '  with the madhav godbole - led re - negotiation committee set - up to facilitate  the restructuring of the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) signed between the  us power major and the state government . officials of dabhol power company  ( dpc ) , a subsidiary of enron , alongwith their team of shareholders and  lenders will arrive here on may 11 for talks with the nine - member godbole  panel . though the dpc spokesperson was reluctant to give a confirmation , a key  mantralaya official told the times of india that the team had expressed  willingness for talks with the experts committee in a bid to end the  imbroglio .  enron ' s response is viewed as a welcome development to amicably resolve the  controversy which had been raging for the last few weeks , with the board of  directors of enron authorising its india md k wade cline to serve a  termination notice to mseb . the state government , on its part , too adopted a  confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for  defaulting on power supply . however , the sudden change of heart by the enron  management is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders led  by industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) which had recently opposed the  move to pull out of the project . this was in contradiction to the stand taken  by the foreign lenders of the dpc who were in favour of slamming the brakes  on disbursement of funds to dpc . the congress - led democratic front government  had publicly declared that it would impress upon the enron management to  renegotiate the ppa as scrapping the project would not be in the interest of  both the parties .  last week , the state government constituted a nine - member panel of experts  under former bureaucrat madhav godbole . godbole had written to the dpc  management inviting it for talks to re - negotiate the ppa on may 5 . for the  delayed response from enron , the meeting has been rescheduled to may 11 . the  issues which would be debated at the meeting include the separation of the  lng facility from the power plant , renegotiating lng supply and shipping  agreements , redefining the dpc tariff and to convert it into a two - part  tariff . the godbole panel will bargain hard for removal of dollar  denomination in the fixed charge component and to allow the maharashtra  government to sell power to third parties .  - - - - -

arrival of its team from houston and other parts of the world .  however , the company has ultimately decided to meet the godbole committee on  may 11 .  dpc spokesman jimmy mogal said :  & we confirm that dpc has been invited to meet  the recently formed negotiating committee . as a matter of courtesy , we have  agreed to meet them next week . since the purpose of our meeting is to hear  out the committee and understand their thoughts , we will not present any  proposals .  8  & while we have constantly maintained that we are open to a  dialogue towards resolving issues , this meeting in no manner be construed as  an open offer from dpc to renegotiate the terms of the contract . furthermore ,  the published terms report do not represent an acceptable basis for further  discussions ,  8 he added . sources said enron corp chairman kenneth lay is likely  to meet former chief minister sharad pawar to find an acceptable solution  for the ongoing crisis before the may 11 meet . mr lay told the foreign news  agency on wednesday that the enron corp has no immediate plans to sell its  stake in the troubled $ 2 . 9 - billion dabhol power project in western india .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  afternoon , may 4 , 2001  houston team to meet godbole  the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) yesterday said it had agreed to  meet the godbole committee "" as a matter of courtesy "" and this should "" in no  manner be construed as an open offer from dpc to renegotiate the terms of the  contract . "" in a statement issued last night , the us energy major made it  clear that the purpose of the meeting with the nine member renegotiating  committee was "" to hear out the panel and understand their thoughts , and not  present any proposals . ""  furthermore , the published terms of the godbole report did not represent any  acceptable basis for towards resolving issues .  earlier , state government sources said that a team of senior officials from  enron headquarters in houston is slated to attend the first godbole  renegotiations committee meeting , now to be held on may 11 . the panel  deferred its meeting from may 5 as in a formal communication , dpc requested  the state government for a suitable date other than the stipulated one , they  said . however , the multinational is yet to send a list of its nominees , who  are due to arrive next week , they said .  meanwhile , the centre is likely to appoint solicitor general harish salve as  its representative on the high - power committee to renegotiate the power  purchase agreement ( ppa ) signed between dpc and maharashtra state electricity  board . other members of the godbole committee are hdfc chairman deepak  parekh , teri director r . k . pachauri , former union energy secretary e . a . s .  sarma , kirit parikh of indira gandhi institute of developmental research ,  maharashtra energy secretary v . m . lal , state finance secretary s . k . srivastav  and mseb chairman vinay bansal .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  business standard , friday , may 04 , 2001  salve may represent centre on enron talks panel  solicitor general harish salve is likely to be named the centre  , s  representative on the high - power committee appointed by the maharashtra  government to renegotiate the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the us  energy giant enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) . according to highly  placed government sources , salve  , s name has been cleared by both ministries  of finance and power .  the maharashtra government has appointed a negotiating committee headed by  former bureaucrat madhav godbole to renegotiate the estranged ppa signed by  the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) and dpc . enron had made  opening of talks with maharashtra conditional on the presence of a centre  , s  representative on the negotiating committee . salve would meet secretaries in  the ministries of finance , power and law to firm up the centre  , s stand on the  crisis arising out of payment defaults by mseb , sources said adding that  petroleum secretary is also likely to be included in the panel .  sources said enron appeared to be keen on solving the present impasse through  negotiations judging from corporation chairman kenneth lay  , s statement  yesterday in houston that the company had no plans to sell its stake in the  $ 2 . 9 billion dabhol project . the government is likely to make a formal  announcement of salve  , s appointment on the negotiating committee by the  weekend , sources said . the negotiating committee would suggest solutions to  bring down the exorbitant power tariffs , separating of the liquefied natural  gas ( lng ) facility , restructuring of dpc and allowing sale of excess power  through central utilities , mainly the national thermal power corporation  ( ntpc ) , sources said . the dpc board had late last month authorised the local  manager in india to issue termination notice to mseb following a bitter  payment controversy . dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the  centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment  of dues .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  the times of india , friday , may 04 , 2001  salve may represent centre on enron talk panel  solicitor general harish salve is likely to be named the centre ' s  representative on the high - power committee appointed by the maharashtra  government to renegotiate the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with us energy  giant enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) . according to highly placed  government sources , salve ' s name had been cleared by both ministries of  finance and power . the maharashtra government has appointed a negotiating  committee headed by former bureaucrat madhav godbole to renegotiate the  estranged ppa signed by maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) and dpc .  enron had made opening of talks with maharashtra conditional on the presence  of centre ' s representative on the negotiating committee . salve would meet  secretaries in the ministries of finance , power and law to firm up centre ' s  stand on the crisis arising out of payment defaults by mseb , sources said ,  adding petroleum secretary is also likely to be included in the panel .  sources said that enron appeared to be keen on solving the present impasse  through negotiations judging from corporation chairman kenneth lay ' s  statement on wednesday in houston that the company had no plans to sell its  stake in the $ 2 . 9 billion dabhol project .

( they can be by regional wholesale prices as well . ) ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years .  ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data . ege is now updated for the 4 th quarter 2000 ( through december 31 , 2000 ) . ege lst quarter 2000 ( through march 31 , 2001 ) will be available approximately june 15 , 2001 .  ege also compares and ranks generating units ' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility ( as well as other regional generators ) . some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half - load level for lengthy time periods ( without an apparent reliability basis ) , splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units .  other ege supporting data :  i . planned maintenance schedule ( where indicated ) ;  j . actual maximum generating capacity ;  k . actual minimum generating capacity ( actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government - reported values ) ;  l . average heat rate in the full - load range ; and  m . average heat rate in the three - quarter - load range .  with respect to a generating units ' average heat rate in the half - load , three - quarter - load and full - load ranges , it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region . it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities , and changes in recent years in these parameters .  the real - world example of allegheny energy  allegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege . in the 4 th quarter 2000 , for instance , one high - cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning ( 52 times ) and committed for the whole day ( in all but two cases ) . arguably , there are power products that could substitute for this routine ( in part at least ) at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy .  another high - cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn ( nine times ) and committed for most of the coming week . at another plant , two high - cost units were operated too often in the expensive half - load range ( some 550 hours ) and three - quarter - load range ( another 400 to 600 hours ) ; they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels . again , there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy .  offering of energy leader consulting ( elc )  ege is a procedure , not a software package or data base . elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities .  elc transfers its "" knowledge "" about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight - forward four - step process :  1 . enron would select one to three target utilities .  2 . elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities .  3 . employing this real - world analysis as a pedagogic tool , elc , in a one - day seminar with enron personnel , would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future ( without the assistance of elc ) .  4 . optionally , elc would provide ege supporting data , quarterly , to enron .  the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program ( virtually all fossil fuel units ) . parameters that are incorporated , and the data set format , will be specified upon request . custom modifications will be considered .  steven a . mitnick  chief executive officer  energy leader consulting  4807 41 st street , nw  washington , dc 20016  ( 202 ) 997 - 0924 voice  ( 202 ) 537 - 0906 fax  smitnick @ energyleader . com",0

( by taking demand from our  competitors ) . i believe , at the moment , there are no bandwidth exchanges that  allow "" combinatorial "" bids . if we are the first one to do it , we might  improve our sale channel and gain some market share . ( note : auction - > one  seller and many buyers : exchange - > many sellers and many buyers . )  moreover , i think auctioning the unsold bandwidth will not hurt us because we  cannot sell them anyway . in addition , we ourselves can be a dummy bidder in  the system and bid in the auction . if the current wining bid is too low , we  can just over - bid it and keep the product . this way , we can indirectly put a  reserve price on the products .  let ' s meet sometime in the first week of january .  - chonawee",0

687,"Subject: the storage revolution has begun  network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo  on storage in the enterprise  today ' s focus : the storage revolution has begun  03 / 07 / 00  dear wincenty kaminski ,  today ' s focus : the storage revolution has  begun  by amy larsen decarlo  believe the hype . we are in the middle of a storage revolution .  virtually overnight , businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to  terabytes of data , and the number of users accessing that information is  skyrocketing . the subsequent requirements are forcing companies to  rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of  storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery .  it isn  , t just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that  are changing how businesses handle storage . the premium that companies  place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound  effect on their storage requirements . businesses demand fault - tolerant  storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their  employees , suppliers and customers .  but given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements , on average ,  double every 12 months , while processor speeds double every 18 months ,  companies are left with a quandary : how can they manage the  proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for  the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds ?  the simple answer to this question is to institute a well - executed  storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in  advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support  those needs . bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not  from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those  systems .  there are several ways to efficiently manage storage . one of the best  routes is consolidation that is , pooling resources and managing  storage as a system , as opposed to a decentralized collection of file  servers . this may sound like a throwback to an earlier era , when  enterprise storage resided on mainframes . but it  , s actually a  progressive step , as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing  the planning , management , and ongoing support of storage systems than it  does with the physical location of the files .  next , it is important to recognize that not all information is equally  important to the organization . consequently , storage requirements vary  by business application . as in all areas of it , it is important to make  storage implementation decisions based on business needs .  businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for  alternatives to the distributed file server storage model . they want to  speed access to stored files and remove bandwidth - intensive backup and  recovery operations from the lan .  network - attached storage ( nas ) supplies it professionals with one  answer , giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to  stored data . nas devices , which have been widely available for years ,  are optimized to process i / o transactions . though they promise better  performance , they don  , t remove backups from the transport network .  instead , they supply a relatively easy - to - deploy solution to cross -  platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments .  many consider storage - area networks ( san ) to be the best long - term  answer to current and future storage challenges . because sans are  designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network , they  alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated  with more traditional storage models . yet , given the early deployment  stage most companies are still in , many of those capabilities are still  largely untested in a production environment .  this newsletter will examine how , through effective storage management ,  it professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery  to their customers . this newsletter will not focus on items like the  least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library . instead , it will  look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging  technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues .  ultimately , the goal is to identify storage technology options and  practices that work in real - world environments .  to contact amy larsen decarlo :  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  amy larsen decarlo is an analyst with enterprise management associates  in boulder , colo . , ( http : / / www . . com ) , a leading  analyst and market research firm focusing exclusively on all aspects of  enterprise management . she focuses on storage management , application  management , and security . in her position , she oversees market research  and contributes to custom project work in her focal coverage areas .  prior to joining ema , amy spent five years covering enterprise  management for industry trade magazines , including informationweek and  data communications . she can be reached at  mailto : decarlo @ . com  for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page :  http : / / www . nwfusion . com  the national storage industry consortium ( nsic )  http : / / www . nsic . org  the distributed management task force ( dmtf )  http : / / www . dmtf . org  storage systems standards working group of the ieee  http : / / www . ssswg . org  the ietf  http : / / www . ietf . org  subscription services  to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters ,  go to :  to change your email address , go to :  subscription questions ?

699,"Subject: pricing credit on thousands of names  all -  our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] .  most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information ,  making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective .  currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development :  fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par  yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then  default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology .  fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the  libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding  differences .  bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model  regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting  benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs ,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches . under testing .  bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer ,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve ,  then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing .  market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market  prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices .  kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and  database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate  risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next .  each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia ,  capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside  other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system .  our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from  credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a  price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights .  the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc .  the key steps to implementing such a system will be :  establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a  probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to ,  which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping  from rating / score to price .  getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model .  building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural  nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and  software packages to use ?  determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model .  getting the "" true "" market price , in order to feed back an error . at present  such a price exists for very few credits .  allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would  take 6 - 10 man - months to develop .  further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy  asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don ' t yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at ' internet speed ' .  regards  ben",0

849,"Subject: energy leader consulting generation evaluator ( ege )  shirley :  as requested , herein is information regarding the meeting with vince kaminski .  the presentation on the ege tool ' s applications and the allegheny energy case study is timed to take an hour . if the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for tuesday , may 29 , might i request it be set for late afternoon ( as my other appointments are the next day ) .  and , as vince will recall , i was co - leader of the energy consulting business of phb hagler bailly , and developer of the ramp up , real time , 75 check and electric strategy tools . presently , i am ceo of energy leader consulting ( elc ) .  background  the u . s . power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years . rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively . utilities , who still control most power plants , endeavor to adopt the entrants ' methods . yet , inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread .  utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades - old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling . many utilities , notwithstanding the industry - wide trend towards profit maximization , cling to ingrained routines .  inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale . a utility may operate a relatively small system ( fewer than a dozen plants ) . a small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers , playing the wholesale market at the margin .  for a variety of reasons , utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units , let alone shut down any ( even temporarily or seasonally ) . economically inefficient units continue to be committed , week after week , and run in the half - load range .  ege objectives  ege identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines . taking into account transmission and reliability factors , the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant .  i . an industry participant can use ege as a basis for a medium or long - term wholesale power transaction with a utility ; or to price wholesale power more aggressively , to take market share from the utility ( i . e . , compel changes in unit commitment habits ) .  ii . an industry participant can use ege to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition .  iii . a power plant developer can use ege to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility ' s unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized .  specific ege concepts  ege reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities .  it produces indicative statistics such as :  a . the frequency distribution of starts per week ;  b . the frequency distribution of starts by day / 15 - minute segment during the week ;  c . the frequency distribution of load level ;  d . the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start ;  e . average heat rate and approximate fully - allocated cost in the half - load range ;  f . average ramp rate from the half - load range ;  g . the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours ; and  h . forced - off maintenance outage rate ( where indicated ) .  indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month / year ; in some cases , by temperature range . ( they can be by regional wholesale prices as well . ) ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years .  ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data . ege is now updated for the 4 th quarter 2000 ( through december 31 , 2000 ) . ege lst quarter 2000 ( through march 31 , 2001 ) will be available approximately june 15 , 2001 .  ege also compares and ranks generating units ' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility ( as well as other regional generators ) . some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half - load level for lengthy time periods ( without an apparent reliability basis ) , splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units .  other ege supporting data :  i . planned maintenance schedule ( where indicated ) ;  j . actual maximum generating capacity ;  k . actual minimum generating capacity ( actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government - reported values ) ;  l . average heat rate in the full - load range ; and  m . average heat rate in the three - quarter - load range .  with respect to a generating units ' average heat rate in the half - load , three - quarter - load and full - load ranges , it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region . it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities , and changes in recent years in these parameters .  the real - world example of allegheny energy  allegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege . in the 4 th quarter 2000 , for instance , one high - cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning ( 52 times ) and committed for the whole day ( in all but two cases ) . arguably , there are power products that could substitute for this routine ( in part at least ) at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy .  another high - cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn ( nine times ) and committed for most of the coming week . at another plant , two high - cost units were operated too often in the expensive half - load range ( some 550 hours ) and three - quarter - load range ( another 400 to 600 hours ) ; they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels . again , there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy .  offering of energy leader consulting ( elc )  ege is a procedure , not a software package or data base . elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities .  elc transfers its "" knowledge "" about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight - forward four - step process :  1 . enron would select one to three target utilities .  2 . elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities .  3 . employing this real - world analysis as a pedagogic tool , elc , in a one - day seminar with enron personnel , would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future ( without the assistance of elc ) .  4 . optionally , elc would provide ege supporting data , quarterly , to enron .  the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program ( virtually all fossil fuel units ) . parameters that are incorporated , and the data set format , will be specified upon request . custom modifications will be considered .  steven a . mitnick  chief executive officer  energy leader consulting  4807 41 st street , nw  washington , dc 20016  ( 202 ) 997 - 0924 voice  ( 202 ) 537 - 0906 fax  smitnick @ energyleader . com",0

922,"Subject: a better investment than the stock market .  all our mailings are sent complying to the proposed h . r . 3113 unsolicited  commercial electronic mail act of 2000 . please see the bottom of this  message for further information and removal instructions .  parents of 15 - year old - find $ 71 , 000 cash hidden in  his closet !  does this headline look familiar ? of course it does . you most likely have  just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( usa ) .  and reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods -  new zealand ) . his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when  she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried  beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 - year - old  sons closet . nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when  she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . five - dollar bills , twenties ,  fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber - banded in labelled piles .  "" my first thought was that he had robbed a bank "" , says the 41 - year - old  woman , "" there was over $ 71 , 000 dollars in that bag - - that ' s more than my  husband earns in a year "" .  the woman immediately called her husband at the car - dealership where  he worked to tell him what she had discovered . he came home right away  and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . little did  they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than  actually finding it in the closet .  as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via e - mail , a type of  "" report "" to e - mail addresses that he obtained off the internet . everyday  after school for the past 2 months , he had been doing this right on his  computer in his bedroom .  "" i just got the e - mail one day and i figured what the heck , i put my name  on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out "" , says the clever  15 - year - old .  the e - mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one  $ 5 dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top  and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to  the top of the list .  the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand  dollars in five - dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your  name at the top of the 5 - address list . "" i get junk e - mail all the time , and  really did not think it was going to work "" , the boy continues .  within the first few days of sending out the e - mail , the post office box  that his parents had gotten him for his video - game magazine subscriptions  began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ 5 bills .  "" about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box  had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it . there was also a  yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . i thought i  was in trouble or something ( laughs ) "" . he goes on , "" i went up to the  counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . i had to ride back  home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all "" . over  the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e - mail . "" the  money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the  closet , barely had time for my homework "" . he had also been riding his bike  to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ 5 bills for twenties ,  fifties and hundreds .  "" i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks  with like five thousand at a time in my backpack . i would usually tell the  lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the  money ] and he was outside waiting for me . one time the lady gave me a  really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me  and my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just rode to the next  bank down the street ( laughs ) . "" surprisingly , the boy did not have any  reason to be afraid . the reporting news  team examined and investigated the so - called "" chain - letter "" the boy was  sending out and found that it was not a chain - letter at all . in fact , it was  completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws , title 18 ,  section 1302 and 1341 , or title 18 , section 3005 in the us code , also in  the code of federal regulations , volume 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which  state a product or service must be exchanged for money received .  every five - dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read ,  "" please send me report number xyx "" . this simple note made the letter  legal because he was exchanging a service ( a report on how - to ) for a  five - dollar fee .  [ this is the end of the media release . if you would like to understand how  the system works and get your $ 71 , 000 - please continue reading . what  appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -  you can use it too - just follow the simple instructions ] .  be financially free like others within a year ! ! ! before you  say "" bull "" , please read the following . this is the letter you have been  hearing about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the  internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire  show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really  can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the  program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are  "" absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if  people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some  megabucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost "" .  due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this  program has attained , it is currently working better  than ever .  note * follow the directons below , i had best results the second time when  i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions .  in order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so  that the returns are many . i have been extremely successful using the  following company . they send out the offers , and all i do is accept money  for reports , then i send back to the people as soon as possible .  this is what one had to say : "" thanks to this profitable opportunity . i was  approached many times before but each time i passed on it . i am so glad i  finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal  effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received total  $ 610 , 470 . 00 in 21 weeks , with money still coming in "" .  pam hedland , fort lee , new jersey .  here is another testimonial : "" this program has been around for a long time  but i never believed in it . but one day when i received this again in the  mail i decided to gamble my $ 25 on it . i followed the simple instructions  and walaa . . . . . 3 weeks later the money started to come in . first month i  only made $ 240 . 00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of  $ 290 , 000 . 00 . so far , in the past 8 months by re - entering the program , i  have made over $ 710 , 000 . 00 and i am playing it again . the key to  success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change  anything .

 remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people  ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment  what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people  mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on  the internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many people will do just  that , and more !  method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet  advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of  free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will  easily get a larger response .  we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as  you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the  report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all  orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out with your name  and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they  receive the report .  = order each report by its number & name only . notes : always  send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not  accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2  sheets of paper or aluminum foil . on one of those sheets of paper , write  the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail  address and your name and postal address .  place your order for these reports now :  report # 1 : the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net  order report # 1 from :  r . r .  po box 18048  chicago , il 60618  report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk e - mail on the net  order report # 2 from :  gm boland  353 jonestown rd . suite 125  winston salem , nc 27104  report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net  order report # 3 from :  r . chernick  po box 771661  c . s . florida 33077  report # 4 : how to become a millionaire utilizing mlm & the net  order report # 4 from :  m . eiseman  po box 451971  sunrise , florida 33345 - 1971  report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free  order report # 5 from :  l . samon  po box 31  castletown  isle of man  im 99 5 xp  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $  follow these guidelines to guarantee your success :  + + + if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks ,  continue sending e - mails until you do . = orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for  report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until  you do .  + + + once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can  relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will  continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time  your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different  report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which  report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate  more income send another batch of e - mails and start  the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you  can generate from this business ! ! !  following is a note from the originator of this  program : you have just received information that can give you  financial freedom for the rest of your life , with no risk and just a  little bit of effort . you can make more money in the next few  weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program  exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works  exceedingly well as it is now .  remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your  name and address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 thru # 5 as  instructed above . one of the people you send this to may send out  100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on every one of them .  remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers  you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information ,  materials and opportunity to become financially independent .  it is up to you now !

"" let me borrow two dollars today , "" i said ,  "" and i ' ll bring you five dollars next week . "" the investment  was too good to pass up , and other kids were throwing their  lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes . of course  when "" next week "" rolled around and i couldn ' t pony up the cash ,  i promised to pay them even more the week after that ,  if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit  longer .  eventually the end of the year came and went , high school  started and with it came girls , and homework , and parties ,  and sports , and those poor kids from eighth grade had more  things on their mind than last year ' s lunch money .  i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid ,  and i didn ' t even get beat up .  hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market  secrets you will ever learn .  first of all , greed is your number one enemy . you ' re not  going to turn $ 2 into $ 5 in a week , so cash out when  you ' re ahead . don ' t wait for the boat to sink before  grabbing the lifejacket .  second , never trust an investment adviser of any kind .  they are looking out for their own money , not yours .  the "" professionals "" , those stuffy investment counselors and  money managers , will always tell you that the best time to  buy is now . according to those guys , the longer you keep  your money in the market , the more money you ' re going to make .  ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is  "" never "" .  in a sense , they are right . if you put $ 250 , 000 in an index  fund right now , you ' ll probably have over a million dollars  in thirty or forty years . but here ' s the problem :  do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich ?  hell no !  you want the money now - so you can enjoy it . it ' s hard to  make use of your fortune when you ' re seventy years old  in a wheelchair . if you could make a million dollars in  the next few years , what would you do with it ? where would  you travel ? what kind of car would you buy ?  the fact is . . . youth is the best time to be rich .  if your goal is to make quick profits in the market , volatility  is your ally , and stability your enemy . you want to see  those large upswings , two hundred points in a day , followed  by the four hundred point crash a week later . you don ' t  care if the market went up or down 20 % this year as long  it was unstable . that ' s how you ' re going to make the  money .  what i ' m talking about here is day trading .  my father invests the traditional way ; he holds some good stocks  and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k . in the long term of 5 - 10 years  he makes money .  the day trader buys or sells 5 , 000 shares of xyz for a  $ 25 , 000 profit in a 5 - 10 minute trade . he acts quickly , taking  advantage of all the information at his disposal about a  certain stock , and estimating whether it will go up or  down within hours , sometimes within minutes .  i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing  amounts of money at it . it ' s not rocket science , and you  only need to learn a few basic principles to get started .  society would have you believe that successful trading is  complicated and requires formal training .  the truth is , wealthy people use very simple investment  strategies to make money .  popular media and investment professionals portray successful  trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing  ring . they don ' t want the competetion - and they sure as hell  don ' t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm  to execute a trade for which they ' d charge you forty or fifty  dollars .  they make their money only if you believe two lies :  1 ) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average  person .  2 ) that using an investment adviser who charges a high  commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks  per trade .  here is what the financial gurus in today ' s society absolutely ,  positively do not want you to know . . .  the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact  so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend  a few hours of studying .  after reading over 200 financial books and publications  during the past decade , and after using day trading  to successfully make more than four million dollars in  the stock market , i ' ve learned the following lessons :  * * achieving financial success is incredibly simple .  * * anyone can do it .  * * it only takes a few hours to learn .  when i discovered the secret to day trading , i didn ' t become  wealthy overnight . if you want instant cash , drive to wal - mart .  buy a ski mask and a shotgun , and rob your local bank . the  only way to get rich , quick or otherwise , is through  hard work , knowledge , and determination .  after learning the fundamentals of day trading , i started  practicing the trading art itself , and the first few weeks  brought modest gains . the next few months gave me the practical  experience i needed to really earn a living , and i was pulling  close to a six figure income . in less than three years with no  formal financial training , minimal effort and only moderate risk ,  i had made my first million . the knowledge that i gained  during those formative trading years i am willing to share  with you in my new book , the master trader . you will learn from  my mistakes , and from my successes , as i teach you the simple ,  secret formula for day trading that i ' ve used profitably  year after year .  the income of the day trader can be staggering . thousands , even  hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within  minutes . the difference between making money and losing your  shirt is simply this : knowledge . i will provide that knowledge ,  and i will give you a winning edge at this high - stakes game .  average income of a day trader :  5 % average an income in excess of $ 500 , 000 per year  22 % average an income in excess of $ 250 , 000 per year  35 % average an income in excess of $ 100 , 000 per year .  27 % average an income between $ 50 , 000 and $ 99 , 999 per year  11 % average an income between $ 20 , 000 and $ 49 , 999 per year  after reading the master trader , you will discover extremely  profitable , simple yet powerful trading methods that give  you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you  win despite the current market weakness .  here is just a snippet of what i will teach you :  * * * make money whether a stock goes up or down .  * * * learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds .  * * * learn exactly what stocks to trade , the exact price to  buy them and the exact price to sell them .  * * * save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the  mistakes beginners make .  * * * learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money  consistently in every market !  * * * learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance  for great success .  * * * profit on huge intraday price swings .  * * * make money on the biggest news stories .  * * * actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum  returns .  * * * learn how to use the tools and information wall street  professionals use .  * * * learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind .  it ' s time to ask yourself : "" am i going to listen to the  professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell ? or am  i going to take control of my own financial future , and  start making money right now in the stock market ? ""  who is looking out for your best economic interests - some  wealthy wall street stockbroker , or yourself ?  with the master trader e - book , you will learn everything you  need to know in order to get started with day trading . . . from  choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the  lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional  trading strategies that make professional traders millions of  dollars .  the master trader e - book is the most comprehensive yet easy to  understand and straight - forward book ever written about active  trading . if you are serious about success in short term stock  trading - order today and start paving the road to your  own financial future .  oh , and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade ?  his high school friends laughed when he said he was going to  make money in the stock market .  six years later , he bought a beach - front home on the california  coast - with cash . oops , they weren ' t laughing anymore .  in a rollercoaster market like we have today , day trading  is the fastest track to wealth . if you ' re looking  for a long - term retirement investment with no risk  that goes up 5 % a year , then by all means , this ain ' t  your kind of game .  but if you want the quickest possible way to make a fortune  in the market , with the lowest element of risk , then  order the master trader e - book right now . i promise  to teach you all of the secrets that helped me become a  millionaire through successful day trading .  you don ' t need to know anything about the market , and  anyone can do it , with minimum effort . it ' s an easy  game to win if you know how the pieces move .  order the master trader e - book right now for only $ 49 . 97  by clicking on the link below :  http : / / 4 tools 4 life . com / qs  our company is strictly opposed to unsolicited emails .  to be removed from this list , please send an email  to "" bulkexpert @ yahoo . com "" ",1

1003,"Subject: alliance info alert - ferc reporting  attached is a summary of recent ferc activities ( pdf file ) and the weekly  alliance express . the following is a summary of the most recent ferc meeting ,  followed by a listing of the most recent ferc filings .  in a brief meeting yesterday , ferc approved a final rule adopting section 203  merger filing requirements , generally as proposed , and extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time that the new york market can be  determined to be "" workably competitive . "" at the same time , ferc ordered a  technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and  urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next  steps , and deadlines for resolution / implementation . additional details are  provided below .  ferc updates , streamlines merger filing process  ferc unanimously approved its proposed order revising the reporting  requirements for mergers . however , comm . hebert did so with reservations , as  discussed below . commission staff stated that the order closely follows the  notice of proposed rulemaking previously issued , but adds more detail and  more certainty to the industry . staff stated that the order is improved over  the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain  entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products .  according to ferc , the draft order :  - revises the commission ' s filing requirements to reflect existing merger  policy based on ferc ' s 1996 merger policy guidelines ;  - provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market  analyses . the rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with  potential horizontal competitive concerns . in addition , the rule establishes  informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses .  - streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise  competitive concerns ; and  - reduces the industry ' s regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing  requirements .  the rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal  register .  commissioner reaction :  comm . hebert expressed reservations that , although he was voting for the  rule , ferc should not be duplicating the department of justice ( doj ) and the  federal trade commission ( ftc ) market concentration analyses and that ferc  should follow the lead of anti - trust enforcement officials , who could also  analyze mergers faster and more confidentially . he also stated that ferc  should review the filings after the doj or the ftc review them , not before ,  and that there should be a definite time frame for review . hebert did  mention that he was pleased that rtos and the disposition of transmission  assets would be exempt , that ancillary services would be considered as a  separate product and that the final rule opens the door for alternative  market analysis .  comm . breathitt supported the final rule , stating that it should expedite the  approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the  fact that older , irrelevant requirements have been dropped . she indicated  that the final rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting  the public interest by stating that the process will be "" efficient yet  sufficient "" . the commissioner said that she was pleased the final rule  addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail  competition and one of her main concerns , confidentiality .  comm . massey fully supported the final rule , emphasizing that it would  improve response time , lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the  industry to better predict commission actions . like commissioner breathitt ,  massey was pleased that the order will allow market modeling analysis that  will better enable ferc to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants  to point to other factors when concentration appears too high . massey also  stated that the new rule includes the ability to address many of ferc ' s  concerns , such as future mergers when they occur in succession , retail  competition , mitigation by the enlargement of markets through rtos and  analysis of ancillary services . in sum , he averred that the order will  provide ferc with the tools it needs for accurate analysis , while taking into  consideration the rapid changes in the industry .  chairman hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was  a very important rule . in response to comm . hebert , chairman hoecker said  that the doj and ftc actually wait for ferc ' s report before issuing their  own , that the anti - trust enforcement agencies rely on ferc ' s expertise when  reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries . there is a major  positive connection between industry consolidation and rtos and that both are  reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work , he noted . because the  rtos enlarge the size of the subject market , he indicated , rtos will help to  preserve competition . therefore , more and larger rtos should allow for more  mergers , he said . the chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that  joining an rto is a requirement for a merger , but that it would certainly be  viewed favorably .  nyiso bid caps extended until ancillary service market shown to be workably  competitive  in a 3 - 1 decision , with comm . hebert dissenting , ferc extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be  "" workably competitive . "" at the same time , ferc ordered a technical  conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and urged market  participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next steps , and  deadlines for resolution / implementation .  in so doing , ferc rejected certain aspects of nyiso ' s september 1 and 8 , 2000  compliance filing , submitted pursuant to its may 31 , 2000 order imposing a  temporary bid cap through october 31 . the iso ' s efforts to correct market  flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had  not yet satisfied the commission ' s directives , ferc concluded . ferc found  that while nyiso has achieved solid progress in certain areas , overall the  iso has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then  gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the iso ' s non - spinning reserve  market by april 2001 , as the iso requested .  commissioner reaction :  comms . hoecker , massey and breathitt all endorsed the order as an "" imperfect  solution , "" yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the  iso ' s market . comm . hebert faulted the commission for squandering an  opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls .  hoecker and breathitt joined hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack  of the iso ' s progress , but contended that significant outstanding issues must  be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted .  in other action , ferc accepted nyiso ' s and nepool ' s proposed emergency energy  transaction agreement , allowing nyiso and iso - ne to provide emergency service  to each other ( ero 0 - 3638 - 000 ) ;  stricken items included cae - 16 ( nepool ' s 64 th agreement amendment proposing  the elimination of in service and instituting new rules governing certain  import transactions ( ero 0 - 3577 - 000 ) ) .  = = recent ferc filings = =  ( 1 ) rto developments  * iso ne submitted its changes to market rule 17 , market monitoring ,  reporting and market power mitigation , in compliance with the commission ' s  july 26 , 2000 order . erol - 368 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 .  * iso ne submitted its special interim market rule in compliance with the  commission ' s july 26 , 2000 order . ero 0 - 369 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 .  * illinois industrial energy consumers filed to intervene regarding dynegy ' s  filing to request approval for the withdrawal of the illinois power co . from  the miso . erol - 123 - 000 . filed november 6 , 2000 .  * el segundo power filed a motion "" requesting order on request for rehearing  by date certain "" in complaint that challenges the ca iso ' s ability to set the  rates for the energy that it can compel generators to produce for reliability  under its standard form contract . ero 0 - 1830 - 001 . filed november 3 , 2000 .  * ca iso filed an unbundled grid management charge in order to recover its  administrative and operating costs . erol - 313 - 000 . comments due by november  22 , 2000 .  * nepool submitted supplemental information related to its filing of the  sixty - fourth agreement amending the nepool agreement , which proposed the  elimination of in service . ero 0 - 3577 - 000 . comments due by november 14 , 2000 .

1041,"Subject: ees operational risk  per our conversation , here is the model that i have for simon . the notes  that i gave you were from some work i did back in september as i was looking  for volume numbers . the notes show what drives the final cash flow numbers .  briefly , the issue surrounds exactly what is meant by nonmarket and  noncredit risk . ideally , this would be anything that effects npv of the  deal . however , i think that we should limit ourselves to those things that  effect the time and amount of the eam volumes . even here , such a problem set  is quite large . if you glance at the spreadsheet model , you will notice that  there exists a large number of possible items that effect the eam volumes .  if we are to do this rigorously , then it is necessary to tear apart ees ' s  business model , and although such an attempt to do so would be noble , the  scope of such an excercise may be too large . we need a clear definition of  ees operational risk .  briefly , from the ees deals that i have looked at , two things drive their  profit : a long term bet that power prices will go down , and that we can  improve the facility through various enhancements . each of these may be  gleaned from the spreadsheet , as well as the assumptions regarding the  funding of the facility improvements and so on . 95 % of the savings is  assumed to come from power , and 5 % from gas . ( the effeciency gain may not be  explicitly given ) . if we have data that show the realized efficiency gains ,  then it would be simple [ in principle ] to determine a distribution , and hence  a distribution of eam volumes , npv ' s , etc . at this time , i understand that  rac has determined some of the realized efficiency gains , but my knowledge is  quite sketchy . jay hachen may have more info .  if i get a chance , i will try to see if i can do a "" proof of concept ""  excercise , but i have a late january deadline on something else .  another point : even if we are successful in doing this for the spreadsheet  model , ees has chosen to book things differently . i do not have a thorough  understanding of their it systems , but at least in principle , if we can do  this for the spreadsheet model , then we can do it in their it environment  ( data are data are data ) . they may book efficiency gains through improvement  type , such as gains due to compressors , chillers , boilers , etc . if this is  indeed the case , then we need to have distributions for each type of  improvement .  if we are successful on the spreadsheet and not successful with their it  systems , then the other alternative is to build our own reporting system . it  would be similar to a database where the recordsets are replaced by excel  workbooks . it can be constructed in such a way as to enable us to run  simulations and queries , but this would probably take me about five or six  weeks .  finally , don hawkins does operational audits for enron ' s physical assets .  he sends out teams to audit our pipelines and strategic assets . i don ' t  think that he does it for ees , but you might want to give him a call anyway .  - kevin k .  ps : the ees lunch meeting has been moved to wednesdays . jay hachen will  know more .",0

""  2 . a source close to bush economic advisor larry lindsey reported to us  yesterday that "" there was little that the federal government could do  specifically to help , beyond focusing on national issues ( increased  production , transmission capacity etc . ) .

"" read the following .  this is the letter you ' ve been reading about in the news lately .  due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a major  nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the  investigation of the program described below to see if it really  can make people money .  the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal .  their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely  no laws prohibiting the participation in this program . this has  helped to show people that this is a simple , harmless , and fun way  to make some extra money at home . and , besides even if you never  got involved in the program , the reports themselves are well worth  the money . they can help you start and advertise any business on  the internet . that is , these reports stand alone and are  beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet .  the results of this show have been truly remarkable . so many  people are participating that those involved are doing much better  than ever before . since everyone makes more as more people try it  out , its been very exciting to be a part of it lately . you will  understand once you experience it .  "" here it is below ""  * * * print this now for future reference * * *  the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in  taking a look at . it can be started with very little investment  ( $ 25 ) and the income return is tremendous ! ! !  this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity .  it does not require you to come into contact with people , do any  hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave your house  except to get the mail .  simply follow the instructions , and you really can make this  happen . this e - mail order marketing program works every time if  you put in the effort to make it work . e - mail is the sales tool of  the future . take advantage of this non - commercialized method of  advertising now !  the longer you wait , the more savvy people will be taking your  business using e - mail . get what is rightfully yours . program  yourself for success and dare to think big . it sounds corny , but  it ' s true . you ' ll never make it big if you don ' t have this belief  system in place .  multi - level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it  is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford  research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 %  and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi - level  methods .  this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000  millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the  last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people  become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing .  you may have heard this story before , but donald trump made an  appearance on the david letterman show . dave asked him what he  would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch .  without hesitating trump said he would find a good network  marketing company and get to work .  the audience , started to hoot and boo him . he looked out at the  audience and dead - panned his response . "" that ' s why i ' m sitting up  here and you are all sitting out there ! ""  with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct  commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from  sales made by people you introduce to the business .  residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing  time and money once , and getting paid again and again and again .  in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of  others .  the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my  fingers . fortunately , sometime later i reread everything and gave  some thought and study to it .  my name is jonathan rourke . two years ago , the corporation i  worked at for the past twelve years down - sized and my position  was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to  open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many  unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and  creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my  business and i just couldn ' t seem to make ends meet . i had to  refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and  struggling business . at that moment something significant happened  in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that  this will change your life forever financially ! ! !  in mid december , i received this program via e - mail . six month ' s  prior to receiving this program , i had been sending away for  information on various business opportunities . all of the programs  i received , in my opinion were not cost effective . they were  either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial  investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work  or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one  year . it didn ' t tell me i ' d have to write a book to make it !  but like i was saying , in december i received this program . i  didn ' t send for it , or ask for it ; they just got my name off a  mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! !  after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it  correctly , i couldn ' t believe my eyes .  here was a money making phenomenon .  i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me  further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it  out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i  was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal  aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office  ( 1 - 800 - 725 - 2161 24 hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed  legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain  letter , i decided "" why not . ""  initially i sent out 10 , 000 e - mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my  time on - line . the great thing about e - mail is that i don ' t need  any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of  my orders are filled via e - mail , the only expense is my time . i am  telling you like it is . i hope it doesn ' t turn you off , but i  promised myself that i would not ' rip - off "" anyone , no matter how  much money it cost me .  here is the basic version of what you need to do :  your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report # 1  within 2 weeks of your first program going out . if you don ' t , send  out more programs until you do .  your second goal is to receive at least 150 + orders for report # 2  within 4 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do .  once you have your 150 orders , relax , you ' ve met your goal . you  will make $ 50 , 000 + but keep at it ! if you don ' t get 150 right off ,  keep at it ! it may take some time for your down line to build .  keep at it , stay focused , and do not let yourself get distracted .  in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report  # 1 . i kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by january 13 ,  1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . my first step in making  $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done .  by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 ; 46 more  than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my  e - mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every  day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car .  please take time to read the attached program , it will change your  life forever ! ! remember , it won ' t work if you don ' t try it . this  program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the  rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it  won ' t work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money !  in order for this program to work very fast , try to meet your goal  of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 150 + orders for report # 2 and you  will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . if you don ' t reach the first  two goals with in four weeks , relax , you will still make a ton of  money , it may take a few months or so longer . but keep mailing out  the programs and stay focused ! that ' s the key . i am living proof  that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program ,  i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or  risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and  you will be on your way to financial security .  if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble  like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this  a sign . i did ! - sincerely , jonathan rourke  p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look  like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome !  a personal note from the originator of this program :  by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you  should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal ,  could not have been created by an amateur .  let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business  for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was  doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but  it wasn ' t working .  finally , i figured it out . it wasn ' t me ; it was the economy .  inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had  been with us since 1945 .  i don ' t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment  rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there  were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before .  the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were  doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not including  those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down  into the ranks of the poor .  as the saying goes , ' the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . ""  the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to  "" move up "" or "" get rich "" . inflation will see to that .  you have just received information that can give you financial  freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a  little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few  months than you have ever imagined .  follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any  way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a  copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of  the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name  will be on everyone of them !  remember though , the more you send out the more potential  customers you will reach .  so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials  and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to  you now !  "" think about it . "" before you delete this program from your  mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really  think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when  you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no  matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money !  you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you  have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! - jody  jacobs , richmond , va  here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $  this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am  sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days .  before you say "" no way ! "" please read this program carefully . this  is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making  opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all  multilevel businesses , we - build our business by recruiting new  partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows  you to recruit new multilevel business partners , and we offer a  product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are  filled by e - mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you  do it privately in your own home , store , or office .  this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere :  this is what you must do .  1 . order all 5 reports shown on the list below ( you can ' t sell  them if you don ' t have them ) .  * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the  report you are ordering , your e - mail address , and your name &  return address ( in case of a problem ) .  * make sure your return address is on your envelope - in case of  any mail problems !  * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the five  reports . you need all five reports so that you can save them on  your computer and resell them .  * within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the five  reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for  you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you .  2 . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed  next to each report , or their order  on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps "" a ""  through ' g "" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits .  once you understand the way this works you ' ll also see how it  doesn ' t work if you change it . remember , this method has been  tested , and if you alter it , it will not work .  a . look below for the listing of available reports .  b . after you ' ve ordered the . five reports , take this advertisement  and remove the name and address under report # 5 . this person has  made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 !  c . move the name and address under report # 4 down to report # 5 .  d . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 .  e . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3  f . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 .  g . insert your name and address in the report # 1 position .  please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! copy  and paste method works well , .  3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names ,  and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction  portion of this letter .  your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely  you can afford $ 25 ) . you obviously already have an internet  connection and e - mail is free !  to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5  reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing  information which includes how to send bulk e - mails , where to find  thousands of free classified ads and much , much more .  here are two primary methods of building your downline :  method # 1 : sending bulk e - mail  let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes ,  and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000  programs each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 %  response . using a good list , the response could be much better .  also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs  instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out  only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders  for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000  programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people  respond and order report # 2 .  those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the  0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000  send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 %  response to that is i 0 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that amounts to  10 , 000 each of $ 5 bills for you in cash money ! then think about  level five ! that ' s $ 500 , 000 alone !  your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000  + $ 500 , 000 for a total of $ 555 , 550 ! ! !  remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people  you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program !  dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half  sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many  people will do just that and more !  report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e - mailing , and  e - mail software .  method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet  1 . advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive , and there are  hundreds of free places to advertise . let ' s say you decide to  start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to  get only 10 people to participate on your first level . placing a  lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response .  also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10  downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering  results below : lst level - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . $ 50  2 nd level - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . $ 500  3 rd level - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000  4 th level - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 k ) . . . . . . . $ 50 , 000  5 th level - 10 members from those 10 , 000 ( $ 5 x 100 k ) . . . . . . . $ 500 , 000  this totals - $ 555 , 550  remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate  only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen  if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 ' s of  participants .  think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must do is  e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide  same - day service on all orders !

analysis of teleconnections and their expected impact ; 1 to 5 and 6  to 10 day forecasts compared to earthsat ; a 10 day city forecast table for  european cities along with the expected effect on heating demand and finally  a "" port status report "" describing weather and port conditions in 11 worldwide  ports . update traders ( uk and wx deriv ) on changes or new trends in the oz  models . provide a quality assessment of the uk met 6 to 10 and 1 to 5 day  forecast for uk trading .  1330 ( mon - wed ) : brief the crude and products groups in london and houston .  1600 : review 12 z avn for any major forecast changes and communicate changes  to traders .  weekly : produce a weather article for "" critical mass "" - internal trading  newsletter .  of course between 1000 and 1330 we are looking closely at the us weather for  support to you guys in houston . i ' m still writing the daily us executive  summary as well as producing a 6 to 10 day us forecast .  2 ) requested projects :  * gas fundamentals has asked us to provide weather information for their  morning report and website . they would like to be able to gather objective  output from as many forecast models as we can get .  * weather derivatives has asked for week ahead , month ahead , and seasonal  outlooks for temperature and precipitation . they have also asked about  creating a tradeable "" nao index "" and developing an in - house model for  forecasting nao .  * continental power has asked for temperature and precipitation outlooks for  power generation and hydro .  * gas fundamentals , uk trading , continental power , weather derivatives and  crude and products have all asked for a european summer outlook for  temperature and precipitation . we expect to have this completed tomorrow .  * the research group has asked for assistance in gathering climate data  across spain for temperature and precipitation .  3 ) leads to follow up on :  * elsa in houston asked us to contact some of the softs traders here and let  them know once we were up and running .  * contact chris mahoney to determine if we can provide and additional support  for crude and products .  * follow up on a potential morning breifing for continental power  4 ) challenges :  * we ' ve been told that we will be moving locations next week - which might  entail corrupting or loosing the software and hardware configurations that  have taken almost a week to get fully established . it seems that this office  functions on a "" hot desk "" system where people are constantly moving around .  this will make it very difficult to stay connected - as well as very  difficult for our customers to identify us .  * administrative detail take an inordinate amount of time . assembling  reports both physical and electronic can take nearly as long as actually  preparing the reports !  - - -  mike ,  ok - i think that brings you up to speed . i ' ve been amazed at the amount of  feedback we ' ve already gotten and we ' ve only been here 3 days ! on that note  i wanted to let you know that i am fully committed to this project . it seems  that we will not have a second meteorologist to assist tony by my planned  departure date on the 20 th . as such - i can continue in my current role  through my planned vacation - keeping me in london until the 27 th - which is  my current reservation back to houston . i am also open to remaining in  london beyond the 27 th to ensure the success of this project .  hopefully this gives you a good idea as to what ' s gone on in the first few  days here . we look forward to talking to you later today and with you and  vince tomorrow .",0

1118,"Subject: urgent contact  from the desk of : dr tom eke .  e - mail : dr _ tomeke @ spinfinder . com  lagos - nigeria .  attn :  request for urgent business relationship .  it is with my profound dignity that i write you this  very important  and highly confidential letter . first , i must  solicit your strictest  confidentiality in this transaction . this is by  virtue of its nature  as being utterly confidential and "" top secret "" .  though i know that a  transaction of this magnitude will make any one  apprehensive and  worried , considering the fact that we have not met  each other before ,  but i am assuring you that all will be well at the  end of the day . we  have decided to contact you by email due to the  urgency of this  transaction , as we have been reliably informed that  it will take at  least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal  post to reach you ,  so we decided it is best using the e - mail , which is  quicker and also  to enable us meet up with the second quater payment  for the year  2000 .  however , let me start by introducing myself properly  to you . i  am dr . tom eke , a director general in the department  of petroleum  resources ( d . p . r ) and i presently head the contract  award panel incharge  of contract awards and payment approvals . i came to  know of you in my search for a reliable and  reputable person to  handle a very confidential business transaction  which involves the  transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account  requiring  maximum confidence . i and my colleagues are top  officials of the  federal government contract award panel . our duties  include evaluation , vetting , approval for payment of  contract jobs  done for the d . p . r e . t . c . in order to commence this  business we  solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer  into your account  the said funds . the source of this funds is as  follows : in the second  quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to  review and award  contracts to the tune of us $ 400 million us dollars  to a group of five  firms for the supply construction and installation  of oil pipe lines  in warri and port harcourt . during this process my  colleagues and i  decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately  over - inflate the  total contract sum from us $ 400 million to us $ 431  million united  states dollars with the main intention of sharing  the remaining sum  of us $ 31 miilion amongst ourselves .  the federal government of nigeria has since the  second quater of  year 2001 approved the sum of us $ 431 million for us  as the contract sum ,  and the sum of us $ 400 million has also been paid to  the foreign companies  concerned as contract entitlements for the various  contracts done , but  since the companies are entiltled to us $ 400 million  dollars only , we are  now left with us $ 31 million dollars balance in the  account which we intend to  disburse amongst ourselves , but by virtue of our  positions as civil  servants and members of this panel , we cannot do  this by ourselves ,  as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau  ( civil service  laws ) from opening and / or operating foreign accounts  in our names  while still in government service , making it  impossible for us to  acquire the money in our names right now . i have  therefore , been  delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my  colleagues in the  panel to look for an overseas partner into whose  account we would  transfer the sum of us $ 31 million . hence we are  writing you this  letter . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you  or your company  can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our  behalf , you or your  company will retain 20 % of the total amount ( us $ 31  million ) , while  70 % will be for us ( officials ) and the remaining 10 %  will be used in  offsetting all debts / expenses and taxes incurred  both local and  foreign in the cause of this transfer . needless to  say , the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in  return we demand your  complete honesty and trust .  you must however note that this transaction will be  strictly based  on the following terms and conditions as we have  stated below ;  a ) our conviction of your transparent honesty and  diligence  b ) that you would treat this transaction with utmost  secrecy and confidentiality  c ) that you will not ask for more share or try to  sit on the funds once it is under  your custody , or any form of blackmail .  d ) that upon receipt of the funds you will release  the funds as instructed  by us after you have removed your share of 20 % from  the total amount .  please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and  risk free and we hope to conclude  this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days  from the date  of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .  we are looking  forward to doing business with you and solicit your  total confidentiality  in this transaction . there is no cause for alarm . i  give you my word that you  are completely safe in doing business with us .  transactions like this  have been successfully carried out in the past by  most government  executives . here in my country there is great  economic and political  disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant  and the order of  the day , thus explaining why you might have heard  stories of how  money is been taken out of nigeria , this is because  everyone is  making desperate attempts to secure his or her  future , so that when  we retire from active service we donot languish in  poverty . i will  explain more to you when i have heard from you .  please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using  the above e - mail address .  i will bring you into the complete picture of this  pending business  transaction when i have heard from you and also  receive your  confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me  fax to you all  necessary information you need to know about our  pending business  transaction . i will also send to you my private  telephone and fax  numbers where you can always reach me . your urgent  response will be  highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds  under the second  quarter of the year 2002 . thank you and god bless .  yours faithfully ,  dr . tom eke .  n . b . please be informed that this business  transaction is 100 % legal  and completely free from drug money or money  laundering . this is a  complete legitimate business transaction .  - -",1

1263,"Subject: update - reimbursement of individually billed items  the use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few  years . as a result the accounts payable department has seen a rapid increase  in the number of invoices and vendors . with the higher volume , we have  reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle .  although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual  employees , they often mail invoices directly to accounts payable . at times  they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone . in these  cases we return the invoice to the vendor . if the employee is designated , we  try to track him / her down and forward the invoice . the high level of  employee movement among jobs and locations at enron has made this  increasingly challenging . either way , we end up doing something less  productive than paying invoices .  to maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary  for research , we request that employees who have pagers , cell phones , and  other individually billed items such as licenses , subscriptions , etc . , pay  for them by personal check or charge card ( if applicable  * payment instructions  are usually indicated on the invoice ) and request reimbursement through  employee expense reports .  by submitting these charges on your expense report , you can help us reduce  the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices , the number of  checks generated by treasury , the number of vendors in our database , and the  turnaround time for payment of invoices .  incidentally , accounts payable is currently installing a corporate - wide  web - based expense reporting system similar to what enron international has  used for the past year . this will make it even easier to file your expense  report and receive quick reimbursement .  we  , d like to make this effective immediately . if you have any questions or  suggestions , please contact the accounts payable department .",0

1267,"Subject: refined products line - - north american markets - cera alert : decem  ber 15 , 2000  cera alert : december 15 , 2000  title : refined products line - - north american markets  cera knowledge areas : refined products  us margin highlights  * responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels ,  us gulf coast unleaded gasoline margins versus wti fell by $ 2 . 26 per barrel  to average $ 1 . 45 per barrel during november . gasoline margins have returned  to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at  exceptionally high values . cera expects gasoline margins to wti to average  $ 2 . 75 per barrel during the first quarter of the new year , $ 1 . 16 per barrel  lower than this year ' s first quarter average .  * high sulfur no . 2 fuel oil differentials with wti dropped slightly ,  averaging $ 5 . 97 per barrel in november . despite the drop of $ 0 . 37 per barrel  from october ' s average , fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented  values - $ 4 . 20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $ 3 . 46 per barrel greater  that the previous five - year average . for the first quarter of 2001 , cera  anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record  high level of $ 4 . 75 per barrel in the first quarter .  * jet / kerosene differentials versus wti rose $ 0 . 63 per barrel from the  october average , reaching a whopping $ 8 . 59 per barrel in november . in  correspondence with the distillate market , jet / kerosene margins are at  historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight  fundamentals . cera expects jet / kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the  first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the  holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of  $ 5 . 75 per barrel .  * margins for us gulf coast 1 % sulfur residual fuel dropped by $ 2 . 15 per  barrel , reaching $ 3 . 99 per barrel below wti during november . despite the  recent widening of differentials , cera expects soaring natural gas prices to  support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter  months . residual fuel differentials are expected to average $ 2 . 50 per barrel  below wti during the first quarter of next year , at the high end of the  historical range .  us demand highlights  * apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0 . 5 million  barrels per day ( mbd ) from the october level , reaching 8 . 36 mbd for the four  weeks ending december 8 . demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last  year largely because y 2 k concerns helped inflate december demand a year ago .  cera anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder  temperatures arrive , averaging 8 . 08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001 .  * reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3 . 94  mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , over 7 percent greater than this  time last year . this represents a slight increase of about 0 . 05 million  barrels ( mb ) from the end - october level of 3 . 90 mb , but still a record high  level for early december . with support from low home heating oil inventories ,  particularly in the northeast , distillate demand has been very strong during  the fall of 2000 . cera expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter  months , averaging 3 . 79 mb during the first quarter of next year .  * apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the october level  to reach 1 . 68 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite the decline ,  apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year - ago level . the  relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel  distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to  help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals . cera expects the  demand for jet fuel to average 1 . 81 mb during the fourth quarter .  * reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0 . 87 mbd for the four weeks  ending december 8 , a decline of about 0 . 09 mbd from the october average and a  slight increase over the november level . demand for residual fuel is  currently 11 percent greater than last year , and surging natural gas prices  are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout  the winter . residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0 . 85 to 0 . 9 mbd  range during the first quarter of 2001 .  us inventory highlights  * primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196 . 5 mb , increasing  almost 10 mb from the end - october value . responding to rising stock levels  and declining apparent demand , forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to  23 . 5 days for the four weeks ending december 8 . forward supply is 2 . 5 percent  below last year ' s level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the  past eight years - although cera still believes coverage is currently  sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter . however , cera is  looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and  production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the  start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year .  * distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of  october at 29 . 2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 .  despite record high apparent demand , strong refinery production levels helped  boost primary distillate inventories slightly , to 115 . 3 mb for this period .  primary stocks are 16 percent below last year ' s level at this time and at  their lowest historical level ever . although stocks are low , cera does not  anticipate shortages to occur this winter . assuming normally cold weather ,  refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting  demand requirements - albeit at a high price .  * jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage , to  reach 25 . 7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . this  moves jet fuel coverage above the 23 . 5 to 25 days ' supply range that it had  been in for the past four months . the rise of just under 1 day in forward  supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand . jet inventories  and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull  from tight distillate markets strengthen , but supplies are expected to be  adequate for the winter .  * inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply  from october , reaching 41 . 7 days of forward supply during the four weeks  ending december 8 . the increase in coverage was a temporary response to a  drop in demand and an increase in stocks . with demand expected to strengthen  because of colder weather and high gas prices , cera looks for inventories and  coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks .  * * end * *  this cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours .  this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information  from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

1364,"Subject: commercialization of nasa technology  hey , i thought you might like to take a look at viaspace  the cohen report  viaspace was founded in 1998 as a spin - off of the caltech / nasa jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) to transform technologies originally developed for space and defense markets into profitable commercial enterprises . viaspace seeks opportunities in high growth markets delivering on problems with growing global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world . viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets . viaspace target markets are in excess of $ 100 b / yr and growing with a cagr of over 20 % . in the past six years viaspace has created three companies , spectrasensors , qwip technologies and vialogy corp . their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology , ( spectrasensors . com , qwip . com , vialogy . com ) . the company ' s current focus is on three subsidiaries , direct methanol fuel cell , arroyo sciences and ionfinity .  direct liquid methanol fuel cell  direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow ' s fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones . methanol fuel cells ( dfmc ) are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices . a dfmc can power a laptop for up to 10 hours on a disposable cartridge that costs $ 2 to $ 3 . a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to 3 weeks . we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating . as a disposable product , it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc .  the technology is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . toshiba , nec , sanyo , and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers .  arroyo sciences , inc .  arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency , nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation , supply chain , security , logistics assurance and first responder safety markets . the micro tracker product enables a wireless tracking for first responders in hazardous environments . this product combines radio frequency identification ( rfid ) tags , wireless digital communications , ground positioning satellite ( gps ) , data for 2 - d and 3 - d geolocation determination , geographic information system ( gis ) and sensor technologies . real - time processing of many high data content inputs is required for the instantaneous assessment of danger . applications include improved safety for fire department personnel in emergency situations , improved coordination of multi - agency deployments and extended operations in hazardous environments .  the cobra product uses the imaging and sensing technology to provide early threat indicators for coastal surveillance and public infrastructure protection such as ports , power plants , airports , and telecommunication facilities . real time sensory and image data is processed and software is customized to discriminate between friend and foe .  deepscan is a software system that provides automatic analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray and gamma ray imaging . arroyo is currently using deepscan for bomb and hazardous material detection in cargo .  ionfinity  ionfinity has developed the next generation mass spectrometry ( ms ) technology that is 10 times more sensitive than existing ms , with a 10 times increase in mass range . higher sensitivity enables the comprehensive monitoring and detection of biological , chemical and nuclear contaminants . the current market for ms is estimated at $ 1 . 2 billion annually . the compact size and rugged portability will expand the market . new applications include enabling port inspection personnel to detect traces of contraband , epa air quality monitoring and assisting in hazardous material clean up .  additional projects under review  projects not included in our forecast are ( 1 ) a water purification technology and ( 2 ) interactive radio . the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish , sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra - pure water . the water system is scalable from house to municipal usage and will last 25 years while requiring minimal maintenance . the interactive radio enables a listener to receive emails or web sites delivered in response to what is broadcast . the radio station essentially receives input from listeners that could enhance advertising and improve vertical market focus .  forecasts and valuation  we expect revenues for dmfcc will be driven by ( 1 ) increasing wireless usage of computing devices and ( 2 ) the existing need to extend cell phone battery life . we expect revenues for dmfcc will commence in 2007 and grow to $ 195 million by 2009 . homeland security expenditures on airport and seaport security will be a primary revenue driver for arroyo sciences , which will begin to generate revenues in 2005 , and will grow to $ 90 million in 2009 . we expect commercial revenues for ionfinity will commence in late 2007 , and will be $ 10 million in 2009 . beyond 2009 , total revenues will grow at a 60 % to 80 % rate for several years from existing and new products . contracting with existing manufacturers , we expect operating margins will be in the low 40 % range by 2009 . our initial forecasts indicate a fair value range from $ 8 . 40 to $ 11 . 10 based on the projected growth for the 2009 to 2012 timeframe . the graph below outlines our valuation analysis .  directors and management  dr . carl kukkonen , is the ceo and founding partner . dr kukkonen was director for space microelectronics and manager of supercomputing at caltech / jpl , where he worked for 14 years . prior to jpl , dr . kukkonen was the leading expert on hydrogen as alternative fuel at ford motor company .  aj abdallat , coo , and vp of business development has been with viaspace since inception , after working in business development at hewlett - packard and control data corporation .  dr . sandeep gulati has been with viaspace since 2000 . during the prior 12 years , dr gulati was head of the ultracomputing technologies at nasas jpl . dr . gulati is the developer of the revolutionary signal processing technology , qri .  viaspace overview  viaspace was formed in july 1998 with an objective of transforming technologies from caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other advanced technology centers into profitable commercial enterprises through its strong connections with the advanced technology community . through its three subsidiaries - - arroyo sciences , ionfinity , and direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) - - viaspace has a diversified high tech portfolio that includes microelectronics , sensors , homeland security public safety , energy / - fuel cells , information computational technology , rfid , e - finance , and mobile e - commerce .  viaspace develops proven space and defense technologies into hardware and software products that fulfill high - growth market needs and solve today ' s complex problems .  viaspace benefits from important licenses and strategic relationships with caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other universities research laboratories . the viaspace team has a proven expertise for the successful commercialization of innovations in information technology , physical science and life sciences developed at academic research institutions and national laboratories .  the company currently focuses on technologies originally developed for nasa and the us department of defense that have already reached a certain stage of maturity . initial investments in these technologies amount to millions of dollars and many years of rd , enabling viaspace to manage the commercialization process with only a modest additional investment and greatly reduced technical risk .  viaspace couples exceptional technology sourcing and validation capability with a demand - driven process of market validation . decisions about technology transfer and product development are based , first and foremost , on market needs . in addition to our internal expertise , viaspace benefits from the domain expertise of leading experts that serve on our scientific and business advisory boards and from an informal global network of researchers , technology analysts , and technology professionals and investors that would be hard to replicate .  in the last six years , viaspace and its subsidiaries have secured more than $ 30 million in venture financing and strategic investment . initial investors include hewlett packard , divine interventures , los angeles county community development commission , blueprint ventures , the united company , bioprojects international , forrest binkley brown , american river ventures , and nth power .  viaspace has spawned 3 companies : spectrasensors  ( www . spectrasensors . com ) , qwip technologies  ( www . qwip . com ) , and vialogy corp ( www . vialogy . com ) . these companies , currently at various stages of maturity , are positioned within high growth markets and poised for profitability . today , viaspace focuses its effort on its three subsidiaries - - arroyo sciences , ionfinity , and direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) - - and on new high technology opportunities . view full report  view full report  to join market movers mailings press here to find out more .  2400 lincoln ave  altadena , ca 91001  safe harbor statement  this information is a paid advertisement . any views expressed herein are provided for information purposes only and should not be construed as an offer , an endorsement , or inducement to buy or sell securities . bronks communications , inc .

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ?  recently ,  we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and  how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the  next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could  have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all  over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became  obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to  bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics .  merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the  potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another  source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this  business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the  single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online  gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be  an ideal time to is time to invest .  we decided to  find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with  a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging ,  publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a  close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months .  although  ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at  the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old .  the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno .  and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the  keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it  gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream  gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online  gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers  these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the  company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in  the investment community and driving up its stock price .  after a successful north american launch ,  gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese  and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business  decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest  source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach .  what  does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game ,  one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced  management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . .  to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more .  first source data inc .  4535 west sahara ave # 217  las vegas nevada 89102  disclosure and disclaimer  investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first  source data , inc .

1412,"Subject: urgent response  dear sir / madam ,  you may be surprised to receive this letter from me , since you don ' t know me personally . i am mrs maria da costa the wife of dr . john da costa , who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe , i got your contact through network on line in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of a fund to a foreign account and i decided to write you . my late husband was among the zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president robert mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority . before his death he deposited the sum of us $ 15 . 2 million ( fifteen million two hundred thousand us dollars ) to south africa with a security company as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe .  the money was deposited in a din box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the security company . this money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and establishment of new farms in lesotho and swaziland . the land problem arose when president robert mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the "" modus operandi "" adopted by the government .  this resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs , precisely ; more than fifty - one ( 51 ) people have so far been killed . heads of governments from the west , especially britain and united states of america have voiced their condemnation of mugabe ' s plan , subsequently , south african development community ( s . a . d . c . ) has continuously supported mugabe ' s new land act , it is against this background that i and my  family who are currently residing in south africa have decided to transfer my husband ' s money into a foreign account . as a family , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account , where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who is tactically freezing of our family wealth .  and south africa ' s government seems to be playing along with them . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in south africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history . more so , the south african foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an "" asylum "" . as a business person whom i would entrust my future and that of my family into his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is 100 % risk free and that the nature of your business does not necessarily matter .  for your assistance , i will offering you 15 % of the total sum , 80 % for my family while 5 % will be mapped out for any expenses we may incur during the course of this transaction . i wish to  invest our part of the money on commercial property based on your advice .  finally , all i demand from you is assurance that you will not do away with this money when it finally gets to your personal or company ' s account in your country .  if this proposal is acceptable by you , please confirm your interest by contacting us on this phone number + 27724263169 or e - mail address mariadacosta _ 2002 @ yahoo . com  best regards ,  mrs maria da costa ( for the family )",1

1479,"Subject: cera monthly oil briefing - cera alert - december 20 , 2000  title : cera monthly oil briefing : fundamentals update  e - mail category : cera monthly briefing  cera knowledge area : world oil  in the past two weeks , oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength  that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages  this winter . the exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard  to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil  stock situation is at least stabilizing , even if stocks have not built  substantially , and that , thus far , despite a few weeks of colder - than - normal  temperatures , heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key  us market . that has allayed some of the concerns that were driving  speculative interest into the market . furthermore , the potential for weakness  in the us economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in 2001 .  the change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that  iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide , yet , the iraqi export  cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals . if the cutoff lasts  through december , the effect will be pronounced - it would turn a projected  fourth quarter 2000 stockbuild of 0 . 5 million barrels per day ( mbd ) into a  stockdraw of 0 . 1 mbd . we expect iraqi production levels to remain erratic  because of its dispute with the un security council over sanctions , and  exports may again cease . at some point such a development would have a price  supportive effect .  cera ' s price outlook for 2001 remains the same as that in the world oil watch  released in late november . assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or  repeated shutdowns of iraqi production , the projected average for first  quarter 2001 is $ 29 per barrel for wti . however , this outlook is based on  opec ' s announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its  production by the start of the second quarter . a failure to restrain output  would result in a downward adjustment to an average of $ 27 wti for the first  quarter of 2001 , with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in  the first . the downward pressure results from the prospect of a  larger - than - usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about  3 . 0 mbd - with a cut in opec output .  iraq in a twilight zone  as anticipated , iraq ceased exporting oil under the un - controlled "" oil for  food "" program as of december 1 in protest over the rejection by the security  council ' s sanctions committee of its proposed december export price schedule . *  iraq ' s pricing was judged by the un overseers , who monitor the export program  and advise the sanctions committee , to be about 60 cents per barrel below  comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that  iraq was seeking from buyers .  although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues , iraq partially  resumed exporting on december 13 . since then , about 1 mbd has been exported  from the mina al - bakr terminal in the persian gulf . prior to the shutdown ,  iraqi exports under un auspices were at a rate of 2 . 21 mbd for november , as  compared with 2 . 08 mbd for the third quarter . exports for november were about  1 . 3 mbd from mina al - bakr and about 0 . 9 mbd from ceyhan in the mediterranean .  exports from ceyhan have not resumed , owing to the surcharge dispute , with  the result that about 1 . 2 mbd of iraqi crude remains off the market .  iraq ' s semi - shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its  dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues . ( in the midst of  this dispute , the un security council approved phase nine of the oil - for - food  program at the last minute on december 5 ; it became effective on december 6  and has been accepted by iraq ) . as of decemberl 9 , iraq ' s revised export price  for ceyhan , proposed for the remainder of december , has again been judged too  low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions  committee . additionally , the overseers have notified lifters of iraqi crude  that any oil payment made directly to iraq rather than to the un escrow  account would be a violation of un sanctions . buyers of iraqi oil from mina  al - bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a  surcharge to iraq .  how long iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear , but it continues  to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at ceyhan in an  apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the un financial controls that are  the heart of the sanctions system . the distinction that iraq has made between  mina al - bakr and ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at mina al - bakr by  loading two cargoes for the india oil company . iraq may have judged this  accommodation to be in its interest , since it recently also signed an oil  exploration contract with india under which payments would be made in oil . as  currently structured , the deal would violate un sanctions , but india is  seeking an exception from the security council on grounds of economic  hardship . the exception seems unlikely to be granted , which may lead iraq to  cease exports from mina al - bakr again .  there are many possible scenarios that iraq could follow , but we expect  uncertainty about iraqi exports to continue as iraq uses its oil exports as  leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the security  council to end all restraints . consequently , the iraq factor will remain an  element in the oil price outlook .  iraq ' s antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the iraq  issue in washington as the incoming bush administration prepares to take  office . secretary of state - designate colin powell has already acknowledged a  need to reassess iraq policy and has said that he would work to "" reenergize ""  sanctions . the iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign  policy - oriented think tank in washington . a consensus seems to be emerging  around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by  retaining un control over iraq ' s oil revenue and strictly enforcing a  prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general  trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international  irritant . there is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to  destabilize or remove the saddam hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that  the prospects for success are remote .  demand trends  record high us natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for  gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so ,  and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas . interruptible gas  customers with resid or distillate fuel back - up have already switched to oil ,  so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the  already high level of distillate demand . so far in december us distillate  demand is running at a record high december level of 3 . 9 mbd . however , only a  small portion of this demand is the result of economically based  fuel - switching from gas to distillate . cera estimates that the additional  demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is  relatively small , on the order of 0 . 1 to 0 . 2 mbd . in cera ' s view it is likely  that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short  notice because in some cases , this theoretically switchable capacity has not  been used in recent years , and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in  uncertain condition .  switching by interruptible gas customers ( such as utilities ) to distillate  began about a month or more ago , although the volumes involved are relatively  small . switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices  started to surge in the summer . a portion of the us secondary and tertiary  distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible  gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage . given the  expectations of a tight gas market , regulators have been explicit about  enforcing back - up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the  current heating season .  other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching .  some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost  of feedstock natural gas is high . natural gas is also used in some enhanced  oil recovery operations , and some of these producers have also opted to sell  gas back to the grid rather than produce oil .  supply trends  non - opec supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0 . 9 mbd over a  year earlier at 46 . 4 mbd . recent events include a shortfall in mexican  production , curtailed in october by about 300 , 000 bd owing to the effects of  hurricane keith . mexico ' s fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be  3 . 64 mbd - about 95 percent of mexican liquids capacity . norway ' s output  increased 200 , 000 bd from october to november as maintenance season ended .  norway ' s production for the fourth quarter is expected to be 3 . 53 mbd . *  growing russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a  recent surge in exports , in spite of higher export taxes . russian exports of  domestic oil production ( excluding transit volumes ) reached 2 . 5 mbd in  november , after remaining fairly steady at about 2 . 35 mbd from july though  october . fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average 2 . 5 mbd , 0 . 3 mbd  greater than in the fourth quarter 1999 .  cera estimates iraqi oil production averaged 2 . 91 mbd in november - down 0 . 1  mbd from the october level . the cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced  iraqi output for the first 12 days of december to roughly 0 . 8 mbd . iraq  resumed exports of about 1 mbd on december 13 , which raised production to  1 . 80 mbd . assuming no change in iraq ' s current production stance , iraqi  production would average 1 . 41 mbd for december . on a quarterly basis , the  decline in iraq output would lead to estimated opec output in the fourth  quarter of 29 . 0 mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of 0 . 5  mbd into a stockdraw of 0 . 1 mbd . these production estimates include 0 . 15 mbd  of crude oil exports to syria that began on november 20 without un  authorization and are continuing .  oil stocks  us crude oil inventories ( doe data ) have climbed intermittently from an  annual low of 280 million barrels in september and reached 292 million  barrels in mid - december ( see figure 1 ) . since prices weakened in late  november , crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in september  and the ranges seen in october to levels from 289 - 292 million barrels .  primary inventories of us heating oil remain well below year - earlier levels ;  at 48 million barrels they are 15 million barrels , or 24 percent less , than  those of a year ago , but there are indications of builds in secondary and  tertiary inventories . we estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up  5 - 10 million barrels since august and are actually higher than they were at  the end of last year .  in europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with  those of the united states . in november stocks rose nearly 9 million barrels  to 426 million barrels . at this level they are below the highs of 1999 but  well above the low levels of early 1996 ( see figure 2 ) . japanese crude oil  inventories at end - october were 107 . 6 million barrels , which is above the  record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent  years ( see figure 3 ) .  come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids :  strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 -

"" this new market standard should put into place the necessary market  improvements more quickly and at a reduced cost than if we were to implement a  customized market system for new england , "" said william w . berry , chairman and  acting ceo of iso new england . "" now is the time to stop the experimentation .  ultimately , we hope the standard market design will serve as the benchmark for  wholesale electricity marketplaces across the country , if not around the  world . ""  "" pjm is very excited to further standardize a design for a competitive  wholesale  electricity market , "" said phillip g . harris , chairman and ceo of pjm . "" along  with the progress in the implementation of the pjm west concept , this  initiative  will provide an even broader standardized market design . ""  this approach should further expedite the elimination of trading barriers  across  different markets and promote ferc ' s goal of creating a seamless marketplace .  "" we intend to continue to work with the new york iso on issues of mutual  importance , "" stated mr . berry . "" this new market design , together with our  efforts to address the market "" seams "" and other coordination issues , will  eventually bring the three northeast iso markets closer together . "" iso new  england and the new york iso will continue to work together on these issues  under a joint board resolution passed on january 16 , 2001 .  "" because of our geographic location , new york is in the center of the  northeast  markets , with iso new england , pjm and imo each on one of our borders . we  support the continued elimination of barriers across northeast trading markets  to develop a more seamless marketplace where everyone will benefit , "" said  william j . museler , president and ceo of the new york independent system  operator . "" the new york iso will continue to work with our neighboring markets  to remove barriers to trading across the region and to move towards larger  regional markets .

"" standardization requires consistent and reliable technology to facilitate a  market ' s efficiency . a market that moderates price fluctuations and  encourages  investment based on an expected return is an efficient market - - and  efficiency  is the key to establishing market liquidity , "" said alain steven , ceo of alstom  esca .

"" that was my  motivation . the second problem was that the logos themselves , even if it  made sense to do them in gold , made the design too busy - a lot of the  appeal in these "" word "" mugs is the clean , linear look . finally , i think  lack of company and competing business school logos increases the chances  that the academics who come to present their work at our workshop will  display this mug on their desk or on their shelves .  i think the mug will look quite stunning and i think the display of finance  terms will make it an interesting conversion piece - i ' ve never seen  anything like it in academics , let alone in finance . i think enron ' s  sponsorship of the seminar series will get noticed when people follow their  interest in the mugs to say "" what is this ? where ' d this come from ?

1670,"Subject: 75 % reduction in road accidents  august , 2002  dear sir / madam ,  in case you have received this mail earlier , kindly ignore this mail . it may have  been re - sent to you by mistake . ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody .  we have devised a set of systems , which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than  seventy - five percent  we have already filed and are in process of filing further , multiple and appropriate disclosure documents , provisional patent applications at the united states patent & trademarks office ( uspto ) , and also applications under the patent co - operation treaty at world intellectual property organization ( wipo ) at geneva .  there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative . moreover , we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing / minimizing human suffering to a very large extent . there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever . brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings :  statistics advantages  options  economics  we are looking for the followings :  01 . business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable , practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds ; one person mildly injured every three seconds . )  ( c ) current yearly automobile sales worldwide - more than 1000 billion us $ .  ( d ) number of automobiles worldwide - more than 1000 billion pieces  ( e ) daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide  more than 2 billion us $ per day .  ( 2 % of the worldwide gross national product of more than 36500 billion us $ = more than 730 us $ per year = more than 2 billion us $ per day )  theadvantages of the technology developed by us :  a . the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto - insurance . this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles . accordingly , the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction . additionally , because of saving of lives , the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially .  b . as per the who studies and projections , road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today . it is projected by who that by the year 2020 they will occupy the number three positions , next only to heart disease and depression .  by introduction of this technology , we are sure that this will not happen . on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death , in the year 2020 at all .  c . this technology will therefore , make all vehicles cheaper and safer . not only will the cost be reduced , safety which is priceless in itself , will also be greatly enhanced .  as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted , the life of the patent will be 20 years . even at the current levels , with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death , there is a daily loss of two billion us $ . even at the present level , over a period of twenty years , without any interest and without any compounding , this loss works out to be :  2 billion us $ x 365 days x 20 years - 14 , 600 billion us $ .  d . our technology will ensure that at least seventy - five percent of the above losses are prevented . such figure works out to be more that 10 , 000 billion us $ . it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level . as per the future projections , the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase . hence , the figure is likely to be increase very substantially . in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further .  e . at the current levels , more than 1 . 2 million persons are dying every year due to road accidents . even at the current rates , more than 24 million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ( i . e . life of the patent , when granted ) . besides , at the current levels .  3 . 2 million people are injured every year . in the next twenty years , the number of people injured due to road accident , will therefore be more than half a billion .  f . if we add to that the personal , physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents . the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings , are all unmeasurable in quantities , presently known to human kind .  g . considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove , it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity , computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind .  h . the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that , in the very near future , the use of this technology will become unavoidable . it should and will become mandatory by law , to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre - requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future .  i . as described hereinabove ; this technology and its utility are incomparable , outthought of , and unheard of till date . it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures . in future , it can and will be applied to other mode of transport , like aircrafts and trains also .  . among other things , we have the following options available to us : - options  available to us : -  a - outright sale  ( a ) immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration .  ( b ) further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications , before taking steps as outlined in "" a "" .  the process ( b ) will obviously increase the realization in terms of price .  b - licencing options  i ) new vehicles - granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles , individually or collectively , all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis .  ii ) conversion of existing vehicles - to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than 1000 billion vehicles all over the world .  c - combined options  a collaborative arrangement with some private and / or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre - decided sharing ( partnership ) arrangement .  the economics of the project will be as follows : -  1 ) in case any / all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs , the cost escalation may not be more than 5 % to 8 % , and the safety and the protection will be ten times ( more than ) the price escalation . hence , drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation .  2 ) in case , the existing vehicles are modified , the cost involved will be approximately 10 % to 15 % of the value of the vehicle .  but partial modifications at a lower cost , which will give partial protection , may also be carried out . as a thumb rule , the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided .  3 ) in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire , the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable , as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective .  4 ) there are more than 1000 billion motor vehicles in the world at present . besides there are an unspecified number of non - motorized ehicles .  5 ) almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree . the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from .  6 ) among the motorised vehicles , the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out , but over all , some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency .  7 ) even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of 300 us $ per vehicle , the conversion industry works out to be worth 3 , 00 , 000 billion us $ .  8 ) realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety , it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date .  9 ) as pointed hereinabove , the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to , in the range of 1 , 00 , 000 billion us $ per year over the next three years .  10 ) alternatively , considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world , conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition . for such conversion , licenses can be granted on - line , on receipt of on - line payments . in that case , different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size , carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle .  11 ) in case , licensing is done , the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end - user , as per his circumstances and needs . however , piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing .  12 ) it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles , unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created . this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned . the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and / or estimate .  p . s .  1 ) some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct .  2 ) we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point . more details , including website references are available with us and can be provided , if required .

1702,"Subject: urgent reply .  from the desk of : barr arisman shonikon  chambers & associates  no 56 b . aba road , port - harcourt nigeria  private email address ( @ shymail . com )  dear  i sincerely apologize for intruding into your privacy especially by  contacting you through this means for a business transaction of this  magnitude , but due to its seriousness and urgency it therefore became  necessary for me to seek your assistance .  i am barr . arisman shonikon , the personal lawyer to late mr . frank ionescu , a  foreigner , who worked with an oil servicing company in the oil rich niger  delta area of bayelsa state . i am contacting you concerning my late client  and an investment he made . i would respectfully request that you keep the  contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the  information you come by as a result of this mail . i contacted you  independently and no one should be informed of this communication . i would  like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest  to you .  this is a genuine transaction and is 100 % risk free . all i ' m demanding from  you is your honest co - operation to enable us achieve our goal , and not a  perfidious person . on the 6 th of may , 2002 it was reported to us that my  client , his wife and their only daughter were involved in a local plane  crash at kano state , enroot abuja ( the capital city ) all occupants in the  plane lost their lives , unfortunately on this same flight were other  dignitaries like the sports minister and a host of others  meanwhile , until his death , my late client had a fixed deposit account of  usd $ 15 . million deposited in a security company ( unic security company )  here . recently , i received an ultimatum from the security company asking me  to provide my late client ' s relative so that the money would be given to  them . but unfortunately it was discovered that my late client did not  declare any identifiable family member in all the official documents he  tendered to the security company while opening the account .  therefore , this development leaves me as the only person with the full  picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit my  late client made and who is entitled to be the bona fide beneficiary / next of  kin or relative because he died intestate . therefore , if i fail to locate  any of his relatives or his next of kin ( and have this money transferred to  them ) the security company will at the expiration of the 6 weeks ultimatum  given to me confiscate the account .  according to the ultimatum issued to me by the security company , if i fail  to present to them my late client ' s relative , with a legitimate statement of  claim for the money before the given time they will confiscate the account  and the money declared ' unclaimed balance ' . this will result in the money  being taken over by the security company . this will not happen if i have my  way .  since i have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives of my late client  all these while , my proposal , therefore , is to present you as the next of  kin / relative of my client due to the fact that you are a foreigner and can  easily pass as a possible relative of my client . i know you will be  wondering how possible this could be but i assure you that this is simple .  i therefore seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my client  so that the money he deposited with the security company would be paid to  you and there after you and i will share the money 40 % for you and i will be  taking 60 % . i assure you that the deposit would be released to you within a  few days because i have all the relevant information that would facilitate  that will be required on documentation .  first , i will like you to provide immediately the following information :  your full names .  contact address .  telephone / fax numbers .  with this information i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavit  that will put you in place as the next of kin . after we have successfully  satisfied the requirements of the bank the money totaling usd 15 . million  would be paid into your account for you to take 40 % and i will be taking  60 % . all i require is your honest co - operation to enable us see this  through .  there is no risk at all because everything would be done legally and my  position as a qualified attorney will facilitate everything . secondly , i  will give you all the necessary documents that would serve as evidence  proving that you are the next of kin / relative of my late client . these  documents will legally conferm on you the status to act as the beneficiary  of the estate of my late client .  what i related to you might smack of unethical practice but i want you to  understand that this is a once in life time opportunity capable of turning  around our situation . the truth is that this money would not be taken by the  government but by some greedy security company officials and i would not  fold my arms and watch this happen hence my decision to contact you .  if you are interested in doing this transaction with me kindly send your  reply to this email address : ( arismanshonikon @ shymail . com )  thank you as i await your positive response .  barr . arisman shonikon .",1

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with  market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that  most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them  and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting ,  asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options  valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s  real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate  these problems by imposing a market disciplining .  ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials ,  credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have  options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the  story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets  enron has been moving into over the last few years .  on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when  you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am  working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be  wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room .  i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss  some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the  room would be very important to me .  as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 ,  may 3 / 4 are good for me .  regards  nalin  at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote :  > hi ,  >  > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr .  > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some  > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options ,  > etc .  >  > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems .  >  > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about  > the following :  > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly  > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) .  >  > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect  > to telecoms , broadband , etc .  > * who you would like to meet with me - vince kaminski ( our  > boss ) , any other of our colleagues in research , broadband , etc .  > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc .  >  >  >  >  > look forward to hearing from you .  >  > regards ,  > iris",0

supply estimates and several legal requirements and permissions .  in fact , the committee has found that the mseb has been paying enron rs 930 crore more than it should every year . this comprises overcharging of rs 253 crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only 42 per cent of the capacity is used for dpc . there ' s also a rs 100 crore extra billing to the mseb for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge . by charging more than twice the operations & maintenance rate stipulated by the government of india , enron collects approximately rs 246 crore extra every year . it has also been collecting rs 332 crore every year through inflated fuel consumption claims . enron has been charging at 1878 kcal / kwh under the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed it a much lower consumption rate . this gives it a fat fuel arbitrage opportunity at the cost of the people of maharashtra .  the committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation : a rate of rs 32 per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loans , rs 34 . 5 per dollar as reference rate for phase - i , rs 39 . 35 per dollar as reference rate for phase - ii and a curious rs 42 per dollar for calculating government of india tariff . forcing a reduction of these excessive charges has nothing to do with contract cancellation . all it needs is tough negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment .  the godbole committee has established that dpc ' s tariffs can easily be halved if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the dollarisation of payments , the take - or - pay clause and escrow facility ( which is in fact hampering mseb ' s reform particularly in power distribution ) are scrapped . the security of future payments to dpc under the restructured tariff would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system . the committee also gives enron a difficult escape route . it says that if the multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous , it should free mseb from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside maharashtra . the committee has tried to establish another precedent on all projects negotiated by government : "" the public has a right to know what is being contracted on their behalf "" and has recommended that all documents , including contracts related to all independent power projects ( ipps ) , particularly dpc , should be published by the maharashtra government within two months .  also , having established that demand - supply estimates by the state government were fanciful , the committee has asked mseb to defer all negotiations with power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such ipps . it recommends that such negotiations should be in accordance with the least - cost plan spelt out by the report . this should also end the hectic lobbying by reliance ( patalganga ) , mittals ( bhadravati ) , the bses ( saphale ) and others to set up ipps in maharashtra .  - - -

in - fact "" and authorise him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts and financing agreements and their amendments and modifications . top sources told the financial express that dpc would authorise mr cline and / or mr mcgregor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to the state and central governments and mseb under clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa .  "" in response to the continuing default by the mseb of its payment obligations under the ppa , the failure of the government of maharashtra to honour obligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of the government of india to honour obligations under its counter guarantee , the company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conciliation and arbitration proceedings , "" the company resolution said . "" consistent with this recourse to contractual remedies , the company now seeks the authority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices pursuant to clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa from time to time and at any time upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such notices as determined by the company , "" the resolution added .  according to the resolution , the directors , the company secretary and officers of the company and each of them acting individually , are authorised and empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take such other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution , in the name and for and on behalf of the company . against this backdrop , the state government and mseb have been exploring the possibilities of issuing termination notice to the dpc for its failure to meet the contractual obligations under the ppa . the state government and mseb sources said that such a notice could be served by the mseb as dpc has not paid the rebate ( penalty ) of rs 409 crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power on january 28 and february 13 .  the state government and mseb , which reviewed its position on saturday at a meeting convened by the chief minister vilasrao deshmukh , are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the termination notice to the dpc . the dpc ' s move to appoint mr k wade cline as its "" true and lawful attorney - in - fact "" deserves importance especially when the state government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of dabhol power to the power deficit states .  mr cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the ordinary course in amounts exceeding rs 64 crore or the equivalent in foreign currency in any financial year . furthermore , mr cline would be in a position to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relating to the day - to - day operation of the company ' s business or exercise its rights and discharge its obligations under the project contracts and the financing agreements  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - business standard , monday , april 23 , 2001  dpc seeks ok to exit power project , tamal bandyopadhyay otherwise it cannot be a complete exercise , "" he added .  deshmukh and the mseb team are scheduled to meet union finance minister yashwant sinha and power minister suresh prabhu on monday in new delhi to discuss the stalemate and find a acceptable solution for the same .

""  - - energy review committee headed by former home secretary madhav godbole  this could well be the real enron story  a five - member high - powered committee headed by madhav godbole - and including former union economic affairs secretary e . a . s . sarma , hdfc chairman deepak parekh , teri chairman rajendrapachauri and maharashtra government official vinay mohan lal - has recommended a judicial probe into the entire enron power project deal saying it signified "" the utter failure of governance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision - making process relating to the dabhol project "" . the report , which was submitted to the maharashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by outlook , is severely critical of former chief minister sharad pawar ( with the congress then ) , the 13 - day bjp - led union government which reworked the deal in 1996 , shiv sena supremo balasaheb thackeray and his government in maharashtra headed by manohar joshi  "" the utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every step of decision - making relating to the dabhol project . "" madhav godbole committee report  an investigation , if ordered , could embarrass at least these three governments the report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal . according to the committee , the deal reveals failure of governance , both at the centre and state , and across different agencies . "" it strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coincidental , "" the report said , proposing a set of measures to be implemented if something of the project was to be retrieved . godbole and sarma also felt that the panel should categorically recommend the government of india to order a judicial inquiry . this was finally adopted by it . says a congress leader : "" enron could well become the biggest political issue in maharashtra and put to question liberalisation , particularly in the power sector . ""  the proposal has already struck panic . says ncp ' s praful patel : "" if the enron decision has at all been detrimental , it is because of the haste with which phase 2 was cleared by the shiv sena - bjp government . now with the state having already entered into an agreement with enron , the important thing is to resolve it amicably . a judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it ' s not an issue of corruption but that of perception . ""  pro - market congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the centre and the state which invited enron , even though the second phase was cleared by the bjp - shiv sena combine . says congress spokesperson jaipal reddy : "" right now we ' re too involved with the parliament deadlock over tehelka . "" pro - liberalisation congress mps also fear that such witch - hunting could send wrong signals to foreign investors . non - congress mps from maharashtra , meanwhile , claim that the godbole committee was instituted with the express purpose of politicising the enron issue . "" i think i know vilasrao deshmukh ' s gameplan , "" says an mp from the state . but some mps like congress ' prithviraj chavan question the cloak of secrecy that ' s surrounded the deal : "" i ' ve maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examine this "" .  the committee report also says that had the enron project been subjected to a techno - economic appraisal , as envisaged under provisions of the electricity supply act of 1948 and related legislations , the infirmities could have been avoided . since this wasn ' t done , questions about a concerted effort towards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise , the exhaustive 93 - page report points out .  "" i ' d highlight the speed with which the 13 - day vajpayee government cleared the project minutes before it quit , "" says congress mp prithviraj chavan .  the enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberalisation in the early ' 90 s and , despite several controversies , is now an established power project at dabhol , 150 km south of mumbai . in july 1992 , enron signed an mou with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) to set up a 2 , 550 mw station as part of the government ' s ' fast track ' projects .  subsequently , when the shiv - sena - bjp came to power in maharashtra it filed a writ against the project . this curiously led to renegotiations with enron . the committee has quoted a bombay high court order on the renegotiated deal . "" once it ( gom ) decided to revive the project , it acted in the very same manner its predecessors in office had done . it forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency . the speed with which the negotiating group studied the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons , which was accepted by dabhol , is unprecedented . "" says chavan : "" i would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the 13 - day vajpayee government at centre endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned . ""  since the commissioning of the plant in may 1999 , the mseb has paid rs 1 , 607 crore for the power it has bought from dabhol . if the same watttage of power had been bought from indian - built power plants fired by indigenous coal , the payment would have been approximately rs 736 crore . in the first year - and - a - half of its operation itself , the dpc had drained the maharashtra exchequer of nearly rs 1 , 000 crore .  the central electricity authority ( cea ) , in fact , pointed out that the dabhol plant was not the least costly option . the mseb had other inexpensive alternatives like the four units of kaparkheda , but they were in a preliminary stage . the report notes : "" . . . if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pursue these projects , they might not have remained in their preliminary stages "" . it adds that the members were of the opinion that "" the mseb and the maharashtra government erred seriously , based on information available at that time , in proceeding with the dpc as a base - load factor even when its capacity was reduced . "" the failure seems to have been compounded by the laxity of the union power ministry , finance ministry and the cea . it quotes the cea as saying that since the union finance ministry found the tariff reasonable , no further examination was required  strangely , bal thackeray ' s shiv sena , when it came to power together with the bjp in maharashtra , filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the deal .  after the new shiv sena - bjp government took over , its cm , manohar joshi , appointed a renegotiating committee in 1996 which made the right noises , actually managing to reduce the tariff . but certain things remained inexplicable . no fresh clearances were required from the cea , which also said that "" since no cost increase was involved . . . fresh formal clearance wasn ' t necessary . "" says the committee : "" this only adds strength to the suspicion that the cea didn ' t consider the economic aspects of the project at all . indeed , given the non - availability of any official record of the meeting on june 24 , 1994 , with the committee and the nature of this letter dated december 23 , 1994 , the committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of dpc were discussed at all . ' '  the credibility of the shiv sena - bjp government has been seriously questioned . "" the committee finds it unexplicable ( sic ) why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from $ 2 , 828 million to $ 2 , 501 million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating committee , "" the panel observes . says lawyer prashant bhushan : "" it is strange that the shiv sena - bjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly renegotiated the deal . "" the committee further spells out the losses incurred through the deal . "" subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc , the financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid . while the mseb was in profit in 1998 - 99 , it plunged into huge losses of rs 1681 crore in 1999 - 2000 . ""  significantly , the world bank in 1993 had predicted the system ' s inherent weaknesses . in a letter written to the then power secretary , r . vasudevan , a top bank official had said that "" after a detailed review of the analytical framework and costing assumptions , we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that the dabhol project , as presently formulated , is not economically justified "" and that in "" our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb system in 1998 . the proposed base - load operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch , as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be replaced by the higher cost lng power . ""  enron ' s persistence and the ' gullibility ' of the indian side can be gauged from high - ranking enron official joe sutton ' s letter to a key indian official , ajit nimbalkar : "" i recently met with the world bank and have been following the articles in the india papers . i feel that the world bank opinion can be changed . we ' ll engage a pr firm and hopefully manage the media from here on . the project has solid support from all other agencies in washington . ""  the key question in the enron deal is whether a developed state like maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all ? for the first time the godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of such a project . according to the report , the mseb has been one of the better performing boards in the country and has , despite a faulty transmission and distribution ( t and d ) system , managed to consistently earn net revenue surpluses on an accrual basis .  maharashtra accounts for nearly one - fourth of the gross value of india ' s industrial sector . it ' s one of the few states to achieve 100 per cent electrification . since ' 95 , the mseb has been adding to its generation . "" this improvement , which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation undertaken by the mseb , exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpc was being considered , "" the report points out . following a policy of cross - subsidy , roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised .  but the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn ' t been much . in fact , the subsidy claim decreased from rs 630 crore in 1995 - 96 to rs 355 crore in 1998 - 99 , until in 1999 - 2000 it increased nearly five - fold to rs 2 , 084 crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by 26 paise per unit - from 15 to 41 paise - an increase of 173 per cent . "" the increase in the subsidy claim by rs 1 , 729 crore is due to the increase in the gap principally because of the increase in power purchase costs , "" says the committee , adding : "" without the dpc and without problems of t and d loss , the mseb could be financially healthy . ""  but can that happen now since enron is here to stay ? the committee has come up with some far - reaching recommendations : make public all dabhol - related documents and agreements , restructure the dabhol project itself to bring down the cost of power , restructure dpc financially , allow sale of dpc power outside maharashtra , re - examine ppas in accordance with least - cost plans , and thoroughly reform the mseb . the committee know this can become reality only with political consensus and through forming of public opinion . the question is , can that be achieved in an unstable political environment ?  with priya sahgal  making of a scam  ? 1992 : centre invites enron to set up ' fast track ' power project  ? dec 1993 : first ppa signed with mseb  ? 1994 : enron starts construction  ? 1995 : sena - bjp govt scraps enron  ? 1996 : state govt renegotiates project  ? 1996 : 13 - day vajpayee govt approves counter - guarantee  ? may 1996 : state cabinet clears ppa  ? may 13 , 1999 : phase i commissioned  ? jul 1999 : financial closure for phase ii  ? oct 2000 : mseb defaults on payment , subsequently stops paying monthly bills  ? feb 6 , 2001 : enron invokes central government ' s counter - guarantee  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - business standard , monday , april 23 , 2001  mseb revenue collections up at rs 968 crore in march , renni abraham  the maharashtra state electricity board ' s ( mseb ) revenue collections in march 2001 stood at a record rs 968 crore . this was largely due to the disconnection drive on defaulter connections - - pegged at nearly 20 , 000 disconnections a month - - which resulted in compliance by consumers . with the dabhol power company ( dpc ) monthly financial burden issue now a topic of discussion among arbitrators on the negotiating table , the mseb has turned to putting its house in order .  as if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed as the facilitator to the entire dpc tariff crisis , the state electricity board has put matters relating to its performance on record . for instance , mseb has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended march 31 , 2001 , at 45930 units , compared with the previous year ' s 45582 units , making it the top seb of the country in this respect . similarly its power stations recorded the highest availability percentage at 86 . 1 up from 84 . 6 per cent last fiscal . plant load factor is up to 72 . 78 per cent , compared with 71 . 7 per cent in 2000 .  the parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten years of its life time in 2000 at 4545 million units , which made it eligible for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines issued by the government of india carrying a cash award of rs 12 . 5 lakh . all other power stations in the state , without exception , also fulfill the eligibility criteria for the cash award , a senior mseb official said . similarly , the chandrapur power station became the first power station of any state electricity board to get the iso 9002 certification .  a senior mseb official said : "" earlier mseb was suffering from too much interference in its day to day functioning . the agriculturists were touted as the major reason for its deteriorating accruals , while theft of electricity during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged under this head . in the recent past , the government has authorised mseb to take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials , many of whom , including a chief engineer have suffered suspensions",0

1946,"Subject: info you requested kcc  thank you for your interest !  judgment coursesoffers an extensive training  course in "" how to collect moneyjudgments ""  if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a  money judgment is and why processing money judgments  can earn you very substantial income .  if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you  will have a money judgment against them .  you are happy you won but you will soon find out the  shocking fact : its now up to you to collect on the  judgment . the court does not require the loser to pay you .  the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser  down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts ,  real estate , stocks and bonds , etc .  very few people know how to find these assets or what to do  when they are found . the result is that millions of  judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten .  in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a  dime .  the non - payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic  proportions . right now in the united states there is  between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney  judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more  judgments take its place .  we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have  actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this  business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid  profession in which only a select few will be trained in the  techniques necessary to succeed .  with our first hand experience we have built a course which  teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown  and exciting field of processing money judgments .  by following the steps laid out in our course and with  reasonable effort you can become very successful in the  processing of money judgments .  the income potential is substantial in this profession . we  have associates who have taken our course and are now  working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per  year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00  and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operateout of  their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable  organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business  offices .  today our company and our associates have over 126  million dollars in money judgments that we are currently  processing . of this 126 million , 25 million is in the form  of joint ventures between our firm and our associates .  joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break  even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on  the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting  capability is so extensive that government agencies , police  officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us  for reports .  many of our associates already have real estate liens in  force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars .  legally this means that when the properties are sold or  refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 %  interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments .  annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to  $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the  payment of the principal .  our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per  year . this is just for interest , not counting principle  and not counting the compounding of the interest which can  add substantial additional income . typically companies are  sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest  an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell  their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars .  92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 %  are women and 36 % are part time .  one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are  not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off  for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are  working on will be there when you return . the judgments  are still in force , they do not disappear .  the way we train you is non - confrontational . you use your  computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you  never confront the debtor . the debtor doesn ' t know who you  are . you are not a collection agency .  simply stated the steps to successful money processing  are as follows :  mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals  with money judgments . ( we train you how to find out who  to write to )  8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you  and ask for your help . they call you , you don ' t call them  unless you want to .  you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to  sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and  50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for  $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 .  you then go on - line to our computers to find the debtor  and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to  assist you . they range from credit reports from all three  credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment  locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc .  the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to  1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge  $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other  companies charge $ 25 . 00 .  once you find the debtor and their assets you file  garnishments and liens on the assets you have located .  ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the  course )  when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to  the original judgment holder .  once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of  judgment to the court .

1951,"Subject: alliance info alert : ferc report on western markets  at its special meeting today , ferc released the results of its eagerly  awaited probe into california ' s summer power crisis , concluding that under  certain circumstances , california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and  unreasonable power rates due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market  structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions  throughout the west .  the ferc staff report on western markets and the causes of the summer 2000  price abormalities , entitled , part i of staff report on u . s . bulk power  markets , is available at the following website :  in response , ferc issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural  changes to the california iso and px to help remedy the pricing problems , and  solicited public comment by november 22 . a technical conference has also  been scheduled for november 9 , to discuss the proposed solutions and other  remedies that might be suggested ( details tba ) . while all four commissioners  supported the order , the order stretched the commission . chairman hoecker  and comm . breathitt expressed strong endorsements , while comms . hebert and  massey concurred , citing areas where they felt the commission had either  "" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , as discussed below . a final order is  expected to be issued by year ' s end .  at the same time , the commission warned california consumers of their  continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve  state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability of day  ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand responses ; ( 3 )  siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of sufficient  reserve requirements .  highlights of proposed california structural remedy  in its order , ferc proposed a series of market overhauls , including :  ( 1 ) eliminating the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s  investor - owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px , and allowing  these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other  alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks .  ( 2 ) requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their  transactions in the day - ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for  under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements ) , in  order to discourage over - reliance on the real - time spot market .  ( 3 ) establishing independent , non - stakeholder governing boards for the iso  and px .  ( 4 ) modifying the current single price auction system by ( a ) imposing a  temporary $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap "" that prohibits supply bids in excess of $ 150  from setting the market - clearing price for all bidders ; ( b ) requiring sellers  bidding above $ 150 / mwh to report their bids to ferc on a confidential , weekly  basis and provide certain cost support ; and ( c ) requiring the iso and px to  report monthly information on such bids . the commission ' s price mitigation  measures would remain in effect through december 31 , 2002 .  ( 5 ) declining to order retroactive refunds for the state ' s ratepayers and  utilities , citing insufficient authority to do so , but subjecting sellers to  potential refund liability for transactions from october 2 , 2000 until  december 21 , 2002 , but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs , if  ferc finds non - competitive behavior .  ( 6 ) encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand  response management programs .  separately , the draft order rejected the iso ' s request for an extension of  its current purchase price cap authority , and the px ' s request for price  capping authority .  commissioner responses  comm . herbert reluctantly concurred , noting that his decision may change when  a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at  the november 9 meeting . he stressed that he would have preferred that the  order address four areas : ( 1 ) eliminate all price controls in california  markets ; ( 2 ) abolish the single price auction entirely ; ( 3 ) terminate the  "" buy and sell "" mandate in the px ; and ( 4 ) direct the iso to address a long  list of cited problems in its january 2001 rto filing , rather than having the  commission prescribe specific remedies .  hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the "" soft cap ""  concept , if one had to be adopted , then the soft cap should increase  incrementally increase over time at specific pre - announced dates . he  believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in  facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive  for california regulators to address market design and other flaws . also , he  would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time , but  allow the iso and px to address this issue in their january 2001 rto  filings . in addition , he would not dictate risk management methods ,  preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on  their own . finally , he advised californians not to be so environmentally  focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation  capacity .  comm . breathitt stated her approval of the order while warning that ferc  cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress  towards open and competitive markets . she noted that it was the commission ' s  job to guide the market to self - correct and not to conduct "" command and  control . "" she also commended the managers of the iso and px , saying that  they have performed admirably . however , she noted she is awaiting comments  on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential  reporting requirements .  comm . massey concurred , but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive  approach . he feels that the congress has "" put its thumb on the scale "" in the  federal power act to protect consumers . stating that prices will continue to  be unreasonable in the future , he believes that this order moves in the right  direction , by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over  reliance on the spot market , lack of demand response , the need to  reconstitute governance of the iso and px and the elimination of the buy / sell  mandate . comm . massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the  $ 150 / mwh soft cap went far enough , whether ferc has the legal authority to  issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a  certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market  price volatility .  finally , chairman hoecker stated his strong support of the order , but noted  that this is "" no time to pull punches . "" he emphasized that the commission  needed frank comments from the industry . he echoed comm . breathitt ' s warning  that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on  track . noting that the commission lacked authority to order refunds , he  stated that the responsibility rests with congress . addressing  jurisdictional issues , he stated that siting problems encountered at the  state level are slowing the "" meandering transition "" to competition . he feels  that the state of california and ferc need to work together to resolve these  problems and that ferc is not attempting to usurp power . rather , california  is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region  for reliable energy , thus placing the burden on federal action to make things  work , hoecker maintained . the chairman also said that the commission will  fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further  evidence provided by staff ' s ongoing investigation .  if you have any questions or comments , please call jack cashin at  202 / 508 - 5499 .",0

2009,"Subject: data for moody ' s riskcalc  craig and kim ,  as you know , i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody ' s riskcalc .  you wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc .  well , after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through today ' s 2 - hour moody ' s presentation , it is necessary for us to have information about enron ' s counterparties to move to the next step with riskcalc .  we have obtained some information on enron ' s european counterparties from our colleagues in the london office .  we need for you and / or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us with a list of enron ' s north american counterparties .  more specifically , to evaluate moody ' s riskcalc we will need the following financial inputs for enron ' s north american ( private firm ) counterparties :  fiscal year  the prior twelve months of financial data are represented . annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables , such as cost of goods sold , net income , sales , and ebit . the value should be a four - digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000 . forecasts until the year 2009 can be made . a constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last year ' s ( 1999 ) inflation level . in general this ' estimation error ' will not cause any great problems , as size affects default rates at very large scales ( e . g . , $ 10 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 000 , 000 makes a significant difference , $ 1 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 050 , 00 does not ) .  cash & equivalents  this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities .  inventory  inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet , in thousands dollars , without any alterations for accounting method ( e . g . , lifo , fifo , average cost ) . this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue . specifically this would include purchase cost , sales cost , sales taxes , transportation costs , insurance costs , and storage costs .  current assets  this item primarily represents cash , inventories , accounts receivables , marketable securities , and other current assets .  total assets  total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars . for example , $ 15 , 500 , 000 should be entered as 15500 . specifically , total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property , plant , and equipment plus other noncurrent assets ( including intangible assets , deferred items , and investments and advances ) . leave previous year ' s total assets blank for australian companies .  current liabilities  liabilities are positive values . included in current liabilities are short - term debt , accounts payable , and other current liabilities .  total liabilities  this balance sheet account , total liabilities , is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long - term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities ( including deferred taxes , investment tax credit , and minority interest ) .  retained earnings  retained earnings , a historical measure of performance , is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders . typically , it is the prior year ' s retained earnings plus net income less distributions . retained earnings are generally positive . some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings . leave this field blank for australian companies .  sales  this item consists of the industry segment ' s gross sales ( the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period ) reduced by cash discounts , trade discounts , and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers .  cost of goods sold  entered in thousands of dollars , this value is generally a positive number less than sales . it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production , such as material , labor , and overhead . not fixed overhead or items that would be included in selling , general , and administrative expenses . leave this field blank for australian companies .  ebit  earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation . it can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income .  interest expense  this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short - and long - term debt . typically , we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities . one measure of computing this is : interest expense = 0 . 07 * total liabilities .  net income  this item represents the income ( or loss ) reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations . a loss is represented by a negative sign . for example , a $ 5 , 000 , 000 loss would be entered as - 5000 . leave previous year ' s net income blank for australian companies .  extraordinary items  positive or negative , this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement . the items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations . these items include extraordinary gains / losses , income ( loss ) from discontinued operations , and cumulative affect of accounting changes . expenses are entered as negative values , gains as positive values . leave previous year ' s extraordinary items blank for australian companies .  country  this model is calibrated for the united states , canada , and australia .  we look forward to receiving this information for enron ' s private firm north american counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of riskcalc .  thanks ,  iris",0

""  2 . debt restructuring - guarantees , but no direct state money  davis also told the videoconference that he believes the $ 12 billion in back  debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up  during a 90 - day forbearance period ( whether that period has been agreed to by  all creditors is not something we are clear about right now ) . davis ' idea , as  he laid it out in the meeting , is to use the forbearance period to securitize  the debts and sell them against the utilities ' forward rate base or by  establishing a  medium - term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees .  in both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without  direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to  paydown their debt . one of the reasons davis wants to stay close to the  $ 50 - $ 55 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can  pay  down this debt . there is a strong chance that davis will agree to use state  guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations , but he remains  opposed to using direct state money . this frustrates both clinton  administration and utility creditors , but davis has not yet shown much  flexibility .  3 . eminent domain / reregulation  perhaps most frustrating to the washington dc free market crowd at treasury  and the white house was the continued comfort davis and his group of political  advisers have with "" non - market "" solutions to the energy crisis . although  the governor ' s aides actually believe the weapon is more a "" way to force  eventual  agreement , than an actual solution , "" the talk returns frequently to these  non - market mechanisms . "" we have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by  the  tuesday deadline . if we make no progress . if this thing looks like it will  turn into a genuine crisis , then we will use our powers of condemnation and  we will re - take  the plants and equipment and run them ourselves , "" a close political aide to  davis said . "" we will absorb the plants , the transmission lines and the  reserved parking  places of the executives . the legislature would agree in a second . """,0

2053,"Subject: re : lng may 19 decision  john ,  this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions .  1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash  and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the  decision  to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island  project ( please , see point 2 ) .  2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest  ( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island  transaction . the next step  will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions  in one place and  to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is  meeting to close a few  remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 .  a few comments on the book design and my view of the project :  a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island  facility  by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent  supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term  contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions .  the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long - term  contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are  setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos  but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and  coordinating  the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words ,  we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction .  b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension  option of  5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we  have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for  such a long tenor . this is  essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread  and  i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread .  one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the  first  5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side .  c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions  regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a  big prudence reserve  in case we mark it to market .  d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island  deal  ( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions .  long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail  that  correlates very well with brent .  vince  john sherriff  05 / 14 / 2000 01 : 40 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : lauren urquhart / lon / ect @ ect  subject : lng may 19 decision  vince  i haven ' t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well .  anyway with greg moving to his  new role i have ( i hope only temporarily ) staff trading oversight for the  eastern hemishere plus lng .  i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for  lng and lng ship values . i also understand  that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19 ( not very far  away ) . anway i understand this  is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet . can you  please let me know where you stand now ?  i will ask my assistant lauren to set up a time that i can speak with you in  the next couple of days and if you  have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well .  look forward to connecting with you vince .  john",0

""  i waited patiently . i knew boys like to play . they ' d come to me in  their own time .  on day two , the oldest two were doing summersaults over my lap .  the youngest , ben , took a little longer , but yesterday he raced me  across the yard thirty times and won every time .  the weekend brought back memories of my own childhood . we had  such imaginations . in our minds , a tree was a tower to spot  approaching bad guys , a big rock became a mountain , a fallen log a  space ship headed to the stars . we had toys , but we had to use our  imagination , not like the new toys i see my grandkids with .  our toys didn ' t talk , and if they did , you pulled a string to  make it work . we had blocks to build , crayons to create , trucks and  cars to push . they were simple toys that required imagination . i  thought about the toys in my garage , the ones i saved , when my  children outgrew them . they were simple and needed their imagination  to work . mr . potato head allowed them to learn parts of the body and  giggle at the funny face with an ear where its mouth should have been .  i still have an old plastic phone . it has a dial to turn , a  bell that rings when you push a button , and that ' s it . it doesn ' t  talk , squawk , beep or move around the room . it ' s simple and was used  when they played house , nurse , doctor , and secretary .  i have a toy doctor ' s bag , with all the plastic doctor ' s tools .  i remember all the broken bones , cuts , bangs , scratches and aches my  daughter repaired as i lay in her office moaning .  most toys today do it all . we don ' t need imagination - - it  comes in a box . video games that take us into another world or  reality , talking toys , with vocabularies better than most people ,  computerized toys to teach the alphabet . kids sit and have  imagination brought to them . the teaching toys are great , but  children tire of them - - it ' s like being in school .  when my son was young and tired of his toys , he would come to me  and say , "" dad , i ' m bored .

"" ,  i have to blush & say . . .  persistence and personality .  of course , i always follow the advice with my own little  disclaimer : what makes me successful may not work the  same for you . . . & your first lesson is to get over  the deep - seeded idea that success - of any kind , in  my opinion - is somehow an unknown , unattainable secret .  clearly , it is not . it ' s not unknown . it ' s not unattainable .  it ' s not years of digging to find the "" secrets "" to internet riches .  one thing that "" gets to me "" so often in my work as an  internet consultant , author and internet success  strategist is that so many people on the net seem to  have this incredibly huge mental block that stands  between themselves and success on the net . it ' s  almost as if they ' ve been barraged by so many claims  of what works and what doesn ' t work , and so many  long , complicated routes to actually succeeding in  their online venture , that "" success "" is the equivelant of a 100 - foot high brick wall .  it ' s not that difficult , my friends ! it is not that complicated ! !  long - time friend and business associate rick beneteau  has a new ebook out called branding you & breaking  the bank . get it ! !  http : / / www . roibot . com / bybb . cgi ?

"" it is roxxy ' s vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major  labels ' lack of commitment to their artists and customers ; labels that  cast aside established artists who can no longer generate multi - million  selling recordings , but who consistently release albums which sell  hundreds of thousands of records to a large and loyal fan base ; artists  that can easily generate revenues between $ 1 and $ 5 million per title , ""  stated john shebanow , roxxy ' s ceo .

""  mr . shebanow concluded , "" while there are smaller labels that do provide  a home for these acts , they lack either the will or financial resources  to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the caliber we have  on staff require . and no company has the unique combination of great  producers , in - house distribution and dedication to the artist and the  customer that controversial entertainment will possess .

2362,"Subject: business intent  dear sir ,  i am stanley woodwork , the secetary of africa white farmers  co - operation ( awfc ) of zimbabwe . after the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president mr . robert mugabe won the presidential election , the  government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme . this programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white african farmers for redistribution to black africans . this programme has attracted worldwide  condemnation from world leaders including british prime minister , mr tony blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of  victimization and physical abuse .  two weeks ago , our headquartes in harare was attacked and  looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building . fortunately , they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which  belong to the co - operation . this cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government .  now i have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe . the cash in question is us $ 46 million dollars .  once i can get your commitment and sincerity of investing  this funds on our behalf then i would proceed to get the funds freighted to europe , where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us .  you do not have anything to worry about as i would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe , and the business proposal is 100 % legal and risk free .  you would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe .  please get back to me if you can be of assistance and i would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government .  i expect 100 % confidentiality and your prompt response to  this mail so as to proceed . you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork @ email . com  kind regards ,  stanley woodwork .",1

"" let ntpc and power trading corporation of india ( ptc ) come  together and sell dpc ' s surlpus power . we have already mooted this  suggestion , but a favourable reply is yet to come from the union power  ministry , "" the official said . the official said that the centre , which was  also responsible for dpc project as it has provided counter guarantee to  enron india , should form a special purpose vehicle for sale of the excess  power to other states . the state government ' s reaction comes in wake of union  power minister suresh prabhu ' s discussion with chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh in delhi few days ago . it was learnt that prabhu told deshmukh  "" there is no question of ntpc buying power from the project since long term  ppas have been signed by ntpc with the buying states "" .  deshmukh had suggested that the central power utility should sell excess  power over and above the 300 - 400 mw needed for the state from the dpc ' s 740  mw phase - i and soon to be commissioned phase - ii of 1 , 444 mw , to other needy  states . considering the high cost of power generated from dpc , which during  the recent months has hovered around rs 7 per unit as against an average cost  of rs 2 . 30 - 2 . 80 a unit from central and state utilities , there would be few  takers for the power from dabhol , the power minister reportedly said .  "" deficit states will buy dpc power only when the cost of power is brought  down , "" he said , adding power ministry would facilitate wheelng of this power  to the buyers .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  business standard , monday , 7 may 2001  reliance allowed to hawk power from patalganga to third parties  arijit de , s ravindran & renni abraham in mumbai  in an unusual departure from normal practice , the maharashtra government has  allowed the reliance group to sell power generated by its 447 - mw patalganga  power project directly to third parties if the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) does not lift power . the project  , s power purchase  agreement ( ppa ) has a clause to this effect . the state government  , s  permission to reliance to hawk power to third parties has to be seen in the  context of its dithering on forwarding to the centre the dabhol power  company  , s bid for mega power status so that it could sell power to third  parties .  dpc sources told business standard several weeks ago that the company  , s  application had been pending with the chief minister  , s office for months .  only now has the state government authorised the godbole committee to  negotiate with dpc on third party sales outside the state . the dpc project  is facing the threat of closure following mseb  , s inability to buy power from  it , thanks to the board  , s weak financial position . not only can the  reliance group sell power to third parties within maharashtra , but it can  sell power to utilities outside the state . the ppa does not expressly bar it  from doing so . nor does it specify the category of customers to whom power  can be sold . so , in effect , this suggests that the group could sell power to  industrial and commercial customers in maharashtra and emerge as a rival to  the mseb . the state electricity board derives over 80 per cent of its revenue  from such consumers .  apart from captive power plants , independent power producers in india are  allowed to sell power only to state electricity boards . they can sell power  outside the state only if they qualify for mega power project status . with  its 447 - mw capacity , the patalganga project is not eligible for such status  because mega power rojects are supposed to have a minimum capacity of 1 , 000  mw . speaking on the sidelines of a press conference last week , reliance  industries managing director anil ambani told business standard : a provision  in third parties . ambani was answering a question on whether the mseb  , s weak  financials and inability to offer escrow cover to the project as emphasised  in the godbole committee report set up to defuse the dabhol crisis would  derail the patalganga project .  the ppa does not have any express restriction as to third party sale outside  the state , a reliance spokesperson confirmed on friday in a faxed response  to questions . a senior mseb official explained that the state government  cleared private power projects some years ago on the basis of the  unrealistically high demand projections contained in a report by a former  mseb official . subsequently , it was realised that the state would be stuck  with excess power . so the reliance group was permitted to sell power to third  parties , he said . the patalganga project along with the ispat group  , s 1 , 082  mw bhadravati project has been put on hold till the godbole committee submits  its second  report .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  the economic times , may 7 , 2001  no need of patalganga , bhadravati power : mseb  the axe seems to have finally fallen on the much - delayed reliance  industries - promoted patalganga and ispat industries ' bhadravati power  projects in maharashtra as the state electricity board has firmly told the  government that "" there is no need of these projects nor their power "" . the  loss - making board has communicated to the government that mseb had "" no  interest "" in patalganga and bhadravati , as it did not have escrow - able  capacity and also that industrial demand for power had slowed down  tremendously in maharashtra , state government sources said here on sunday .  "" in last november itself , mseb had sent an official intimation to the state  government informing its decision in favour of cancellation of the two  projects on several grounds - - including they being unviable and  unaffordable , "" sources said . "" reliance ' s project is no different from that of  dpc ' s . patalganga is also naphtha - based and its ppa is on similar lines . . .  after the enron experience , mseb cannot even dream of another gas - based  power plant in the state , "" a senior mseb official said . he said mseb has  already asked the state government not to provide escrow to both the 447 - mw  patalganga and the 1 , 084 - mw coal - based bhadravati , "" as the us energy major  has almost squeezed us of all over finances "" . when contacted , mseb chairman  vinay bansal said : "" reliance and ispat projects have been put on hold as per  the godbole committee ' s recommendations "" , but expressed inability to give  further details .  currently , bhadravati and patalganga projects have been put on hold as per  godbole committee report , which was set up to review the dpc - mseb ppa and  energy scenario in maharashtra . "" can you go ahead with the project without an  escrow cover ? "" the committee was believed to have asked ispat and reliance  representatives , to which the reply had been negative , sources added .  sources said , as of now , both the projects have not been able to achieve  financial closure as leading financial institutions were not willing to  fund the projects which do not have a "" guaranteed payment "" mechanism from  mseb , which , incidentally it has promised to dpc .

"" ten days have passed since the lenders bought three  weeks time from the company delaying its declaration of the termination of  the ppa . since then , nothing has moved at the material level barring mseb ' s  payment of the january bill to the tune of rs 134 crore under protest , "" said  a source among the global arrangers . come forward to meet its obligations  the lenders are planning to meet around mid - may in london and this time  they will be left with no choice but to give the go - ahead to the company to  terminate the ppa unless the finance ministry comes forward to settle the  issue , the source added . the lenders are , however , not ready to take the  blame for any delay in the termination of ppa as implied by the company . the  white & case statement said the lenders are concerned about the fate of the  project and they are exploring all intermediate steps before choosing the  last option - - termination of ppa .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  business standard , saturday , 5 may , 2001  ge may pull out as dpc supplier , s ravindran in mumbai  after us - based bechtel , it is now the turn of general electric to review its  participation as equipment supplier to the controversial 2 , 184 - mw power  project in maharashtra , being set up by the dabhol power company . bechtel is  the epc contractor to the project while ge has supplied the equipment ,  primarily turbines . general electric , like bechtel , also holds 10 per cent in  dabhol power company ( dpc ) . and both bechtel and general electric are worried  about future payments from dpc . sources familiar with the project said that  so far dpc has not defaulted in its payments to general electric . what is  worrying general electric is the possible scenario after june 7 , when about  700 mw power will be commissioned after the second phase trial runs .  dpc and the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) have been locked in a  payments dispute for months . if mseb continues with its stance , dpc in turn  may not be able to pay general electric . in such a situation , ge may walk out  of the project . a final decision will be taken only in june , said sources .  general electric did not respond to a faxed questionnaire sent by business  standard . senior executives at its public relations agency burson  marsteller roger pereira said that only dpc executives were authorised to  speak on the issue . the dpc spokesman declined to comment on the issue .  the first phase of the 740 mw has already been commissioned . after the second  phase of 1 , 444 mwis commissioned by december , 2001 , mseb will have to pay  dpc a minimum of rs 500 crore per month . the escrow account for this was to  have been made operational by april 7 , 2001 . mseb has refused to do this .  earlier , dpc had invoked the political force majeure clause in its contract  with the board . mseb is now arguing that the invocation of this clause has  absolved dpc of all its liabilities .  consequently , it will not operationalise the escrow account . this casts a  further shadow over dpc  , s ability to pay general electric and bechtel . this  is worrying the lenders to the project as well . the situation has taken a  turn for the worse with dpc practically refusing to re - negotiate the contract  for the second phase with the godbole panel constituted by the maharashtra  government .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  hindu businessline , may 5 , 2001  agenda for fresh talks with enron chalked out  officials of the state government , maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb )  and members of the madhav godbole committee , which recently submitted its  review on the dabhol power project , met here on saturday . the meeting was to  ` ` chart the agenda for renegotiation with enron officials , ' ' a senior mseb  official said . enron officials were scheduled to attend this meeting but  backed out on may 3 . enron had informed the state government that it would  not accept the recommendations of the godbole committee .  ` it is understandable that the company does not find the recommendations  acceptable . but the report is not bound to personal opinions , ' ' the official  said . the next meeting to decide the direction of renegotiation process with  enron is scheduled on may 11 .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  the economic times , may 6 , 2001  godbole panel meets sans dabhol representation  the godbole committee , set up for renegotiating the estranged power purchase  agreement between us energy major enron - promoted dabhol power company and the  state electricity board on saturday held its first internal meeting sans  representatives of the multinational .

( statistical data included )  john d . schulz  03 / 26 / 2001  traffic world  page 25  copyright 2001 gale group inc . all rights reserved . copyright 2001 journal of  commerce , inc .  truckers still waiting for signs of pent - up freight demand ; earnings  shortfalls , layoffs loom  if you are waiting for trucking to kick - start the nation ' s economic recovery ,  pull up a chair and wait awhile . trucking ceos say they haven ' t seen this  slow a first quarter in a decade .  "" perhaps the weakest first quarter for freight demand since swift became a  public company in 1990 , "" phoenix - based swift transportation chairman and ceo  jerry moyes said .  the first - quarter trucking mantra historically has been this : everybody loses  money in january , hopes for a break - even february and earns whatever profit  there is in the quarter in march . that formula may not hold this year .  gregory l . quesnel , president and ceo of con - way transportation services and  emery worldwide parent cnf inc . , said the current slowdown was first detected  late in the third quarter last year and has become "" more pronounced in each  successive quarter . "" march , he said , has been "" as disappointing as the first  two months this year . ""  layoffs already are occurring at the major ltl carriers . yellow freight  system has idled as many as 1 , 000 teamsters and hundreds of white - collar  back - office workers . most large carriers are warning of profit shortfalls  that will cause them to miss analysts ' first - quarter estimates . but there are  deeper fears , too . marginal players may be forced into bankruptcy . small ,  family - owned carriers may be unable to exit the industry on their own terms  because of the shocking decline in the value of used trucks that is causing  some companies to be valued at less than half their worth of just two years  ago .  swift ' s volume drop - off began with shipments originating on the west coast in  january and february and it is continuing in march , moyes said . coupled with  reduced demand from the southwest , moyes said swift will not meet analysts '  first - quarter earnings expectations . swift is not alone .  "" we hauled less freight in february than february a year ago , "" said bob  hammel , executive vice president of pittsburgh - based pitt ohio express , a  leading privately held eastern regional ltl carrier . "" the slowdown in  manufacturing began in the middle of last year and it was precipitous . nobody  anticipated the speed in which manufacturing demand fell off . ""  even con - way , the most profitable ltl operation in the past five years , said  it would have a decline in first - quarter operating income compared with the  year - ago period . con - way ' s tonnage declines were estimated in the  "" mid - single - digit "" percentage range .  roadway express estimated that its current tonnage levels are running 10 to  11 percent below those a year ago , which will result in an approximately  one - half of 1 percent ( 0 . 5 percent ) decline in its operating ratio . ( see  sidebar )  pat hanley , overnite transportation ' s senior vice president and chief  financial officer , said freight figures were flat in february year over year  but rose slightly in march . overnite is the exception to the ltl industry  with as many as 24 new terminals scheduled to be opened this year .  "" january was pretty good to us , but february was flat . it ' s coming back in  march . we ' re probably up in low single digits , 3 to 4 percent . we ' re picking  back up . the economy has hurt us . if you had asked us at the start of the  year , we ' d have said we ' d be up double - digits , "" hanley said .  the national economic picture is "" a big concern , "" hanley said . "" we ' re not  seeing pressure on prices , at least not so far . we ' re seeing customers ship  10 pallets a day instead of 20 . the shipment size is coming down . certainly  we ' re concerned . we ' ll do o . k . , but not as great as we ' d like . ""  forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever  stars align in federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan ' s world . the  genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking , which  is always a first - in , first - out industry in any economic slowdown .  to hear trucking industry leaders tell it , get comfortable with beans and  franks for dinner . it ' s going to be awhile before it ' s filet mignon time  again .  shippers see what ' s happening as well but say it ' s still too early in the  year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks .  "" all the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business  levels - - definitely slower than early last year , "" said bill huie , assistant  vice president of corporate transportation for nch corp . , irving , texas .  "" with a couple of exceptions , carriers we talk with have no plans for  expansion in the next few months . we are getting feelers about some possible  lane adjustments to boost revenue . but generally it appears a little early in  the economic downturn for much price movement . ""  the national ltl carriers are seeing the same things . "" our business is down  pretty substantially for the first quarter , "" said roger dick , spokesman for  yellow corp . , parent of yellow freight system and two large regional ltl  carriers , jevic transportation , delanco , n . j . , and saia motor freight ,  duluth , ga .  usfreightways corp . , citing what it called the nation ' s "" serious economic  slowdown , "" said it expects first - quarter earnings to fall "" very substantially  below "" current wall street consensus .  extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating  environment , usf chairman , president and ceo samuel k . skinner added .  "" traditionally , the first quarter builds momentum slowly , with march being  the strongest month of the period , "" skinner said in a statement . "" this year ,  the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of 2000 accelerated in january  and february , softening even the normal modest expectations for those two  months . ""  it ' s not just the ltl industry that ' s hurting . the morgan stanley dean witter  truckload freight index continues to show the worst demand - supply  relationship since analyst james j . valentine began tracking the data in  april 1994 . two events can cause weakness in the index , according to  valentine . they are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak  freight demand .  "" so far in 2001 , we have seen the confluence of both factors , but the  fall - off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply , "" valentine wrote  in his most recent "" trucking snapshot "" for early march .  year - to - date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over  year , according to valentine ' s index , while supply is up only 7 percent . that  would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was  "" masked by the strong economy , "" valentine says .  in a more ominous note , valentine believes overcapacity will continue to  plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years . only a  reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand - supply back in balance  for the truckload sector in the near term , valentine predicts .  the overproduction of new class 8 trucks from early 1998 through early last  year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at  manufacturers , wholesalers and other retailers . used trucks have lost on  average more than 30 percent of their value over the past 18 months .  anecdotally , one used truck dealer , music city truck & equipment , in  lavergne , tenn . , is holding a "" two - for - one "" sale on three - to five - year - old  class 8 freightliners . you can buy two for around $ 30 , 000 , less than a brand  new chevy suburban suv .  what that means is a trucker who bought a 1998 class 8 truck for $ 70 , 000 and  depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the  books this year at $ 35 , 000 . but assuming it has lost 30 percent of that  value , it may only be worth $ 24 , 500 in actuality . for a carrier with a  100 - truck fleet , that equates to a loss of more than $ 1 million on assets .  the glut may last for a while , according to valentine ' s analysis . assuming a  three - year trade - in cycle , most of the class 8 tractors in the truckload  sector are just now rolling over to the used - truck market . that means that  overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year .  that will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business , as  did nearly 1 , 900 carriers last year that either closed or declared  bankruptcy .  "" we can see from indexes , surveys and other information available to us that  it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in march and freight  demands will continue to be soft throughout the month . based on all of these  factors , we expect usfreightways ' profits for the first quarter to be very  substantially less than published analysts ' forecasts , "" skinner said .  in addition , severe weather conditions including an earthquake in seattle ,  rainstorms in california and blizzards in the northeast have added cost and  decreased efficiencies , skinner added .  expectations at each of usf ' s operating companies have been affected , some  more than others . the ltl , logistics , reverse logistics and  freight - forwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a  similar period last year , skinner said .  further job cuts at usf worldwide , its freight forwarder , would be in the  offing as cost controls at the unit would be "" accelerated "" in the wake of the  softening economy , skinner said . late last year , skinner said the rebuilding  process at usf worldwide would be a two - year process . but the worsening  economy has made that rebuilding job harder , he said .  "" we are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is , in fact , further  impeding progress in this area , "" skinner said . "" during the fourth quarter of  2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001 , the company has taken  steps to increase cost efficiencies . among these actions are a substantial  cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force .  these cost - control efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance  the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions .

? we  realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote  something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the  preface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are .  ?  thanks ,  julie  ( we ' re getting close )  ?  ?  preface  ?  ?  ?  one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk  management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for  the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss  in - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide  range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses  a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this  last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving  arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent  models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose  consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one  particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we  believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably  be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and  give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all  the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which best suit their needs .  ?  in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ?  in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout  the book .  ?  in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that  can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of  geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility  and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated  and their parameters estimated .  ?  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ?  this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods ,  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different  pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and  electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative  aspects of calculating volatility .  ?  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such  curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial  markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well  defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy  prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building  forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric  approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic  factors .  ?  chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options , and ladder options .  ?  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the  models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience  yield and interest rate model .  ?  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and  american style options .  ?  chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach  results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the  evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined  volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form  solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient  monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options .  ?  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ?  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the  problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  )  illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the  general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor  hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  ?  chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma ,  historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same  portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the  var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .  ?  finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an  extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present  numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  ?  before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of  how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are  certainly not  & magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management  problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the  riskmetrics technical document  &  ( no amount of sophisticated analytics will  replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk .  8 . ? however ,  the right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier !",0

' s or pre - checked plans , that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications  administered by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) .  global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing  educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback  clause . the state of  california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular  classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful  bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities  portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the  originating school district . this process saves school districts  valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids .  a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may  have access to future business for up to five years , depending on  the term of the piggyback contract .  the strategic focus on california schools  since 1998 ,  california legislation has required that at least 20 % of all new  classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures .  there are five compelling reasons for this trend :  modular  classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as 2 weeks )  they cost  significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs . $ 100 , 000 )  they offer  greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings  they are easier  to finance  they provide  financing incentives  to cope with population growth , the state department of  education estimates that  california will need more than 2 , 500 classrooms each year for the  next four years , which equates to more than 10 , 000 classrooms .  due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout  the california education sector , public and private schools are  expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill their  additional classroom requirements over the next four years .  the california schools budget crisis  on  november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities improvements bond  proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by  california  voters .  this bond measure passage does not include an approximate  $ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school  districts throughout the state .  a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion went before the  voters on the march 2004 .  these bond measures are about three times higher than the  record $ 9 . 2 billion bond  california voters approved in 1998 . the revenue generated from these  bond measures will be used for school modernization programs , which  include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular  classroom construction and renovations .  money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and  private schools ; design upgrades and expand building space at  community colleges and other institutions of higher learning  throughout  california .  gdvi business infrastructure  among global modular ' s asset base is its integrated ,  state - of - the - art , automated manufacturing process which includes  equipment , raw material and marketing collateral that are  specifically designed for the high capacity fabrication of modular  structures .  gdvi employs a workforce of 60 employees and is looking  to add to its workforce as demand increases .  operates out of a sixteen acre site with a 100 , 000 square  foot operating structure .  wholly owned subsidiary ( global modular inc . ) markets ,  designs and manufactures the buildings  wholly owned subsidiary ( mbs corporation ) handles  installation and building renovation .  symbol otc . bb  gdvi  recent price 13 . 5 cents  management team  philip hamilton , ceo and president  mr . hamilton has an extensive and very successful  background in modular manufacturing . from 1996 to feb 2000 he served  as chairman and ceo of pacesetter industries inc . he built this  company from inception into one of  californias  largest manufacturers , producing and installing thousands of schools  and commercial buildings . under his leadership , pacesetter  industries moved into a 5 , 500 , 000 sq . ft . facility in atwater ,  california with branch sales offices throughout the state . the  company employed a staff of over 650 employees and had annual sales  of $ 50 , 000 , 000 .  adam de bard , vice president  mr . de bard has over 6 years of experience in the  manufacturing and business sectors . from 1997 to 2000 he served as  vice president and chief  information officer of pacesetter industries .  ronald kilpatrick , director of finance  mr . kilpatrick has 36 years experience in both domestic  and international development and management of major corporations .  he is a managing partner of pacific rim capital llc which provides  venture capital to projects in the  pacific rim .  recent headlines  global diversified industries , inc . commencing efforts to  increase its u . s . based investor and public relations visibility  pr newswire ( tue 5 : 00 am )  global diversified industries , inc . modular division secures new  order worth more than $ 3 million for immediate delivery  pr newswire ( thu , jun 9 )  wallst . net airing all - new , exclusive audio interviews with gdvi  and geoi  pr newswire ( tue , jun 7 )  wallst . net airing exclusive audio interviews with gdvi and xle  pr newswire ( thu , jun 2 )  global diversified industries , inc . acquires valuable assets  from california modular company  pr newswire ( thu , may 26 )  global diversified industries , inc . modular division  implementing its fourth production line  pr newswire ( thu , may 19 )  talkingstocks . com announces interview with philip hamilton ,  president and ceo of global diversified industries , inc .  primezone media network ( tue , may 17 )  stockguru . com initiates profile coverage of global diversified  industries , inc .  primezone media network ( mon , may 16 )  global diversified industries ' modular division billings total  $ 1 . 4 million in april ;

2459,"Subject: pserc denver meeting  vince ,  the pserc meeting lance and i went to was both interesting  and boring . pserc has 11 school members and 30 industry members . its research  program consists of three stems : markets , transmission and distribution ,  and systems . ( enron ' s interests probably lie mainly in the first stem . )  in morning of the first day , researchers from universities  presented their project proposals . i found some of them  quite interesting . for example , shmuel oren , fernando alvarado ,  tim mount ( of cornell ) propose to study "" market redesign : incorporating  the lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing market  design , "" shijie deng , s . oren et al propose to study "" power asset  valuation model in a market - based and reliability - constrained electric  power system . "" the first got funded but the second did not .  in the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have their  own discussion . i went to the academic discussion and lance the  industry one . i hope my presence there did not make things worse , for  the discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion .  the proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants .  the proposal process goes as follows : researchers first write a short  proposal to appropriate stem committee ( no industry participantion , it seems  to me ) ,  each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top 3 or 4 . the  selected  proposals are then expanded to be present to the industry . industry then  gets to vote which proposals get funded . however , some researchers were  very unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process . there were  accusation of self - ranking , communication between stem committee and  member schools breaking down , and so on . some were even asking for  some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before wrting it  ( the arguement was "" then it was a waste of our time to write proposals "" ,  which i found quite amusing ) .  all in all , i found the process was not taken seriously enough by university  researchers . pserc has been established for 5 years now and it still does  not have a proper proposal screen process , which is hard to believe . also ,  the communication among university researchers , between stem committee  and member schools , and most importantly , between researchers and industry ,  are not smooth as all .  since the proposals are voted by 30 or so industry members , the "" right ""  projects may not get funded . too many participants also make the decision  process very indecisive and quite painful to watch ( lance can comment on  this better ) . they also wanted to spread the fund among all schools which  made the voting a less authoritive .  i believe enron will not get much returns from join pserc ( price tag is  $ 40 , 000  per company per year ) . if we find some projects interesting , we can sponsor  the schools in the form of summer interns , the schools claim that most of the  fund  goes to support students anyway .  alex",0

2479,"Subject: marketpoint license agreement  john / vince :  i really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross  section of your people . thank you very much for setting it up , and thank  you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people .  as i mentioned to john , i am sending you the license paperwork for  marketpoint . i have attached our standard license agreement for your  consideration . as i mentioned , the license agreement covers the entire  bundled product , which includes  ? north american gas , short and long term  ? north american electricity , short and long term  ? world gas  ? western european gas  ? world oil  we are just finishing porting the world oil , world gas , and western european  gas models over from our old ( now obsolete ) software system into  marketpoint , so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of  months . however , the gas and electricity models for north america are  presently complete and tested . that should allow us to give you an  attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout  your worldwide business .  as i understood it , you will want the gas modeling capability first and will  want to defer decisions on electric or other capability . as i mentioned at  the meeting , we are prepared to offer that for approximately  the fully  bundled price . as you read the license agreement , you will see that the  software licenses for $ 100 , 000 annually , the gas data for $ 5 , 000 , and the  electric data for $ 10 , 000 . marketpoint will agree to license you the gas  model plus the data for  the software license plus the data license for a  total of $ 55 , 000 annually . this is just under  the fully bundled price . i  think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting , and from  marketpoint  , s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward  together with enron . if or when enron ever desires to  & scale up  8 to another  model or model ( s ) from the marketpoint portfolio , we will simply scale you  up to the entire license agreement . this will allow you to decouple the gas  decision from any other decisions you might make . ( i will be glad to put  this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move  forward . )  i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our  approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you  might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you  were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same  time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the  benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a  complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i  would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i  look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as  a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to  earn and secure your business .  if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount  marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you  begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1  day training seminar .  our clients are usually very fluent after that 1  day training seminar .  thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a  few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable  before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks  later .  thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that  i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show  anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the  meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .  dale nesbitt  president  marketpoint inc .  27121 adonna ct .  los altos hills , ca 94022  ( 650 ) 218 - 3069  dale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com  - license . doc",0

i ' m  not thinking of any preparation , but more of an informal discussion of the  "" philosophical issues "" related to real options work .  jim  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : jim dyer  sent : thursday , march 30 , 2000 1 : 24 pm  to : ' jclevenger @ optionii . bus . utexas . edu '  subject : re : real options course feedback  josh ,  some very thoughtful observations . as you know , i had invited one  finance professor to our class on arundel , but he was out of town . i do  plan to invite sheridan titman to discuss the issue of using the option  models in situations where there is no underlying security that is traded .  i do think it is important to face that issue , which is actually covered at  a theoretical level in our last couple of readings .  the issue of volatility is also an excellent issue for further  discussion , as you suggest . so far , we ' ve been looking at cases where  volatility is "" given "" . the problem of finding an "" objective "" measure of  volatility for a project reminds me of the problem of finding the correct  risk adjusted discount rate , which is not surprising since the concepts are  almost two sides of the same plate . one approach , of course , is to do some  modeling using traditional decision analysis tools , including subjective  probabilities , but the finance people who write options articles don ' t like  to think about such ideas .  i ' ll try to address these issues in more detail as the semester  continues . i think it was important to surface some of these points early ,  and to come back to them after we have seen how to apply the methods in a  naive sort of way .  thanks for the feedback and comments .  jim  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : jclevenger @ optionii . bus . utexas . edu  sent : thursday , march 30 , 2000 8 : 42 am  to : jim . dyer @ bus . utexas . edu  cc : josh - clevenger @ reliantenergy . com  subject : real options course feedback  after overcoming the initial ( i hope ) overload of materials and tools  presented  thus far in the semester , it appears to me that you are achieving the  objective  of making us comfortable with optionality valuation as applied to a variety  of  problems which are outside the borders defined by a liquid market of traded  financial elements .  as a constructive feedback , you have been forthright with us in marking off  areas of this subject which are still controversial . i also realize that  rightly so , real - world application of this type of analysis without a robust  understanding of finance may degenerate into a succession of assumptions  that  result in a "" house of cards "" effect . my opinion at this point is that two  issues are of potentially "" make - or - brake "" importance if i am to persuade my  superiors to accept these methods for valuations outside the realm of  projects  whose value is primarily driven by the value of commodities backed by  financial  instruments . these issues are easy to guess :  1 ) discounting and risk free rates : i do not sense that anyone in the  class  has put forth convincing arguments as to the proper application of time  value  questions in the absence of liquidity . is there someone within the finance  department that can present a firmer position on this question ?  2 ) volatility : i found winston ' s examples on this metric succinct . i would  recommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to this  subject . my criticism again relates to messy problems . i anticipate  arguments  against real option applications based on the dispute of volatility  measures .  if i were a conservative financial manager , i would argue that :  * * * two - a : implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice of  equity  options is a shotgun approach - - the projects being valued are of a tranche  which may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than the  weighted average measured by the equities utilized . oil , gas and electricty  are  good examples the major players are competing on many different levels of  the  value chain . smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata ,  but  what about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in a  vertically integrated company ?  * * * two - b : based on the following skepticism - if a real option value is  being  proposed for a new business venture ( some new unexploited opportunity , )  there is  some paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in new  ventures and the high risk of failure . this skepticism is likely to be less  acute in high - tech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paraded  before us daily by nasdq touts . it is a much harder sell to "" mature ""  industries .  of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered around  opportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gas  sectors  as regulation is removed . a large proportion of the risk is embedded in  ongoing  changes of public policy on an international basis . as an intentionally  screwed - up example , can anyone other than a financial genius correctly asses  volatility for u . s . companies investing in seed projects in mexico based on  speculation of the inevitable dismantling of the national utility ( cfe ) and  pemex ?

2493,"Subject: var for metals  it is my preference to have an aggregated var methodology for the metals  business as soon as possible ( version la ) . i do not want to poison progress  with my opiniion , but i think that the critical first step is to find a way  to aggregate positions in coarse buckets , perhaps sacrificing precision for  speed , based on "" rules "" that oerations can deliver , research can stand behind  and commercial will accept . , and using an equally coarse var calculation  ( the equivalent of ad - hoc var ? ) that can be delivered to the "" official books  and records "" on a daily basis . this i believe would be acceptable for a 2 - 3  month time frame ( at which time we get versionlb ) as opposed to waiting 2 - 3  months to implement a better process and have nothing in the interim .  ultimately , i would look for version 2 a to be delivered and very defendable  by 1 / 1 / 01 . this will require indulgence and compromise on all fronts but i  cannot conceive of a better way . please let me know if this is consistent  with your understanding . a critical point from my perspective is that the mg  commercial team and metal operations staff understand their role in making  this happen and willingness to accept the consequences . i look for you to  take the lead as leader of the integration to do so . if you need any input  from the rest of us to underscore the importance please let us know . as i  alluded to on the phone , the people in houston that have been involved in the  var process have been through an extraordinary period of detailed scrutiny of  var by commercial and have been hindered by the lack of basic understanding  by all parties as their responsibilities . given the distance and the newness  of the metals personell , i fear that this could set us all up for some  surprises and some very uncomfortable communication , much of which is not  entirely necessary .  thanks  ted  eric gadd  07 / 21 / 2000 11 : 46 am  to : ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , bjorn hagelmann / hou / ect @ ect  cc : richard sage / lon / ect @ ect  subject : attached fax  ted and bjorn -  we plan to release draft recommendations on metal position limits by close of  business on 24 july and have asked vince to prepare a v @ r computational  methodology prior to the 7 / 8 aug bod meeting .",0

! !  follow the simple instruction below and  your financial dreams will come true , guaranteed !  instructions :  = = = = = order all 5 reports shown on the list below = = = = =  for each report , send $ 5 cash , the name & number of the report you are  ordering and your e - mail address to the person whose name appears on  that list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your  envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems .  = = = when you place your order , make sure = = =  = = = you order each of the 5 reports ! = = =  you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them .  your total cost $ 5 x 5 = $ 25 . 00 .  within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the 5 reports from these 5 different  individuals . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the  1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . also make a floppy of these reports and  keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer .  important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report ,  or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in step ' ' 1  through 6 ' ' or you will loose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the  way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it .  remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work ! ! ! people  have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the  money . but it does not work this way . believe us , some have tried to be greedy and then  nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed .  because if you do , it will not work for you . remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! !  this is a legitimate business . you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it .  treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time .  1 . . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this advertisement and remove the name  & address of the person in report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and  is no doubt counting their fortune .  2 . . move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5 .  3 . . move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4 .  4 . . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 .  5 . . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2  6 . . . . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position .  please make sure you copy every name & address accurately ! this is critical  to your success .  take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do  not make any other changes .  save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . to assist you with  marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with  invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where  to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to  get this venture going :  method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally  let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you  and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing  receive only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % ) response ( the response could be much better but lets  just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e - mails  instead of only 5 , 000 each ) .  continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response ,  that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e -  mail each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with  orders . that ' s = 100 people responded and ordered report # 2 .  those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 %  response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 .  those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 5 million e - mail sent out . the  0 . 2 % response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 .  those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e -  mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 .  that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half a million dollars ) .  your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . .  $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . .  grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00  numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst  possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will  still make a lot of money !  remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of  5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or  half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ?  there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands  more coming on line every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more !  method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet  advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places  to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we  strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for  every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it .  always provide same day service on all orders .  this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will  be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report .  = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  the reason for the "" cash "" is not because this is illegal or somehow "" wrong "" . it is simply  about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it  is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to  you .  order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5  cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is  concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper ,  write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail  address and your name and postal address .  place your order for these reports now :  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = report # 1 : ' the insider ' s  guide to advertising for free on the net  order report # 1 from :  y . l . wong  p . o . box no . 71819  kowloon central post office  hong kong  report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net  order report # 2 from :  martin veronneau  c . p . 70058  laval , quebec  h 7 r 5 z 2  canada  report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net  order report # 3 from :  francis kidd  p . o . box 209  homestead , pa 15120  usa  report # 4 : how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net  order report # 4 from :  m . l . frayser  p . o . box 61432  fort myers , fl 33906  usa  report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free  order report # 5 from :  stone evans  600 n . pearl , suite gl 03  dallas , tx 75201  usa  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $  follow these guidelines to guarantee your success :  = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue  sending e - mails until you do .  = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100  orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails  until you do .  * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because  the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is  important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are  placed in front of a different report .  you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are  ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another  batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit  to the income you can generate from this business ! ! !  following is a note from the originator of this program :  you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your  life , with no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can make more money in  the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program  exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as  it is now .  remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and  address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 . . . . . # 5 as instructed above . one of the  people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on  every one of them .  remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach .  so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to  become financially independent .  it is up to you now !

2686,"Subject: capital hill gold - chgi - potential high grade gold deposit  breaking news : denver , june 14 , 2005 ( business wire ) - - capital hill gold , inc , ( chgi ) reports that the company ' s geologists are evaluating a potential high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit located in mineral county , nevada , the project is situated in the vicinity of several operating and past - producing gold mines , including the paradise peak , santa fe and rawhide deposits , after review of usgs geochemical survey work of the project and a study of the geology of other gold deposits in the area , geologists believe that the target would be a high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit ,  virgin deposits : the privately - held 440 - acre project was originally staked by a major gold mining company in the 1990 s , the property has never been drilled and may prove to be a rich vein as early tests have indicated , follow - up work by the company ' s geologist indicated that a major international gold mining company had staked approximately 200 unpatented lode - mining claims in the area during 2001 and 2002 ,  geologists investigating the property for capital hill observed multiple broad zones of silicification extending for considerable distances , samples were collected from several outcrops on the property , and have been submitted to american assay labs in elko , nevada for assaying , based on positive assay results , target and identification , a major claim - staking program will be launched accordingly , as further credible evidence emerges of a significant gold ore deposit , and the first results coming in are showing promise ,  on june 13 , 2005 the company announced in a press release that capital hill ' s management is pleased and encouraged with the first u 3 o 8 ( uranium oxide ) assay returns as well as the noticeable precious metal results and that initial reconnaissance sampling on the company ' s uranium project has returned assays grading 0 , 061 % u 3 o 8 to 0 , 068 % u 3 o 8 of great interest to the company is the fact that the samples taken also assayed positively for precious metals , with results ranging from 0 , 08 to 0 , 22 oz ag / st and trace amounts of gold , the occurrence of silver in conjunction with the uranium mineralization warrants further investigation .  the recent news of the company possibly sitting on a huge untapped gold deposit has the stock in a strong up trend , rallying from 5 cents to 75 cents during the past three months . as the three - month chart illustrates , trading volume has swelled to 300 , 000 shares per day with money flow indicators showing strong inflows , which is representative of a stock that is under accumulation . the positive tape action clearly shows strong investor sentiment about the company ' s leverage on controlling sizable parcels of gold fields . the potential recoverable gold data has yet to be compiled , but as mentioned above , early tests are very promising , which is why investors are bidding up shares ahead of this data .  capital hill gold ' s strategic objective is to obtain controlling interests in properties with excellent exploration potential to become economically significant to world - class ore deposits . chgi intends to acquire mineral exploration properties primarily through the filing of concessions on its own account and in partnership as well as by optioning exceptional properties at reasonable costs relative to the property ' s potential and the financial capabilities of the company .  in recent weeks , chgi shareholders have been on the receiving end of some very promising developments with the new discoveries for gold ore . in addition , the company is aggressively exploring for commercial grade uranium deposits that will supply newly heightened demand from nuclear utilities . since 2003 uranium prices have doubled . 20 % of the world ' s electricity comes from uranium , and the nuclear power plant count is stable and growing . the united states needs to add about 100 nuclear power plants over the next two decades to meet burgeoning demand for electric power and maintain the current generating mix , nils j . diaz , chairman of the u . s . nuclear regulatory commission told reporters in early may 2005 .  as of may 17 , 2005 the company is pleased to report that the claim staking crew and geologist have arrived on site , and have begun staking claims . the area being staked encompasses a large area of potentially commercial - grade uranium mineralization identified by previous work , including geophysical surveys . reconnaissance sampling of the ground being staked has returned assay results approximately equal to those of in - place resources at one of the past - producing uranium mines in the project area .  a chinese news web site reports that china , the world ' s second - largest energy consumer after the u . s . , will spend 400 billion yuan ( u . s . $ 48 . 33 billion ) on building new nuclear power plants by 2020 . this is a bigger number than we have seen in the past . the energy - hungry country intends to increase the amount of installed nuclear power capacity from the current 16 gigawatts to 40 gigawatts within 15 years . nuclear power generation is expected to triple to reach 60 gigawatts by that time . so the market for uranium is in a new bull market .  conclusion  development efforts for gold and uranium on chgi properties are about to commence following the better - than - expected geophysical testing results . shares of chgi have rallied over 10 - fold in just the past three months in anticipation of what the future holds in the way of extractible gold and uranium . once full mining operations are under way , it is our view , that the shares will rally as the business generates its initial revenue stream .  for additional information , visit  investor relations solutions is a communications arm of ir solutions profiles . investor relations solutions is not licensed by any governmental or regulatory agencies and is not a registered investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such , investor relations solutions is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . investor relations solutions is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . this stock advertisement or e -
